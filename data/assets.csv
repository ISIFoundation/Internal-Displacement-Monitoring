• More than 13 million people in the DRC—representing approximately 23 percent of the country’s population—are estimated to be facing Crisis (IPC 3) or Emergency (IPC 4) levels of acute food insecurity, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). In addition, an estimated five million children in the DRC are acutely malnourished, the UN World Food Program (WFP) reports.

• Communities in eastern DRC and the greater Kasaï region are projected to face IPC 3 and IPC 4 levels of acute food insecurity through at least September 2019, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) reports.

• Refugees and Congolese returnees from elsewhere in the region, including more than 172,000 refugees from the Central African Republic (CAR) and nearly 500,000 Congolese nationals expelled from Angola, also remain in need of emergency food assistance.

• Inter-communal conflict in Ituri—a province affected by the ongoing EVD outbreak—displaced more than 300,000 people between early and mid-June, increasing humanitarian needs in the region, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

RESPONSE

• USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (FFP) partners with WFP to provide emergency food assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, returnees, and vulnerable host communities in the DRC. With FFP support, WFP is also providing food assistance to EVDaffected communities. In addition, FFP partners with the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and WFP to provide emergency nutritional support to children in eastern and central DRC.

• FFP collaborates with USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance to jointly support several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance to vulnerable people in eastern DRC.

• Separately, FFP supports NGOs in the greater Kasaï region to provide life-saving food assistance to conflict-affected IDPs, returnees, and host communities. Additionally, FFP works with ACTED to provide emergency food assistance to refugees from CAR sheltering in northwestern DRC.

• FFP also partners with Catholic Relief Services, Food for the Hungry, and Mercy Corps to implement multi-year food assistance and resilience activities that benefit vulnerable communities in KasaïOriental, South Kivu, and Tanganyika provinces.",2019-06-24

Two men aged in their 20s were arrested in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Earlier (5.35pm): Police have released dramatic footage showing the moment a car bomb exploded outside Derry Courthouse.

The footage shows a group of young people walking past the vehicle just minutes before it exploded.

The PSNI released four clips via Twitter on Sunday following the blast on Saturday evening.

Assistant chief constable Mark Hamilton described the bomb as a “crude device” and the attack as “unbelievably reckless”.

Mr Hamilton described the bomb attack as a “very significant attempt to kill people”.

“Fortunately it didn’t kill anybody and fortunately it didn’t cause widespread damage but clearly it was a very significant attempt to kill people in the local community,” he said.

He added they got everyone evacuated “just in time”.

“The bomb detonated just as we were leaving the area and it is only by good grace that local people were not killed,” he added.

Earlier (12:06pm): Two men arrested in connection with Derry car bomb attack

Two men in their 20s have been arrested in connection with a car bomb attack in Derry last night, the police have confirmed.

The attack came shortly after 8pm last night when a vehicle exploded on Bishop Street.

Police and army bomb experts remain at the scene.

PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said the New IRA was their main line of inquiry.

""Our main line of inquiry is against the New IRA,"" he said.

""The New IRA, like most dissident republican groups in Northern Ireland, is small, largely unrepresentative, and determined to drag people back to somewhere they don't want to be.""

Mr Hamilton detailed how a pizza delivery driver was hijacked on Saturday evening, and his car packed with explosives before being left outside the court house on Bishop Street in Derry.

“We believe that some time after 6pm last night (Saturday), in the Quarry Street area of Derry, a pizza delivery driver was hijacked,” he said.

“He had his Ford Fusion car taken off him by at least two armed men.

“Between then and 7.23pm, a bomb was put in that car, driven at least half a mile to outside the court house on Bishop Street and around three minutes later a phone call went in to the Samaritans in West Midlands in England, which was then passed to West Midlands Police who then contacted us.

“In the intervening minutes we had already found the car and started to evacuate the area. At around 8.09pm, the bomb detonated.

“Fortunately it didn’t kill anybody and fortunately it didn’t cause widespread damage, but clearly it was a very significant attempt to kill people in the local community.”

He added they got everyone evacuated “just in time”.

“The bomb detonated just as we were leaving the area and it is only by good grace that local people were not killed,” he said.

Those evacuated from nearby buildings included hundreds of hotel guests, 150 people from the Masonic Hall and a large number of children from a church youth club.

Earlier fears of a secondary device have been ruled out.

No-one was injured in the attack. No-one was injured in the attack (PSNI)

Earlier, the PSNI said the attack was ""unbelievably reckless"" and said they believe that the car had been ""hijacked"" in the city a short time before the explosion.

Politicians have condemned the incident, with Tanaiste Simon Coveney saying that there is ""no place and no justification possible for such acts of terror"".

Derry's SDLP mayor John Boyle challenged those responsible on what the aim was, while DUP leader Arlene Foster said it was a ""pointless act of terror"" which ""must be condemned in the strongest terms"".

Northern Ireland Secretary of State Karen Bradley has said those behind the bomb attack will not prevail.

""This attempt to disrupt progress in Northern Ireland has rightly been met with utter condemnation from all parts of the community,"" she said.

""The small number of people responsible have absolutely nothing to offer Northern Ireland's future and will not prevail.

Our voices across the political spectrum are united. This is intolerable violence and we want to look forward and build a peaceful future for all in Northern Ireland.

""Thank you to the PSNI and emergency services who are working so hard to keep people safe and secure.""

Update - 10.20am: Police describe Derry attack as 'unbelievably reckless'

Police have described last night's suspected car bomb attack outside a court in Derry as ""unbelievably reckless"".

The PSNI are investigating after the incident occurred in the city centre at 8.10pm last night.

Residents were evacuated and witnesses reported hearing a loud bang and seeing a large plume of smoke.

Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said today that a suspicious vehicle was spotted by police 15 minutes before the device exploded.

He said they believe that the car had been ""hijacked"" in the city a short time before the explosion.

Constable Hamilton said: ""At around 7.55pm last night officers on patrol in Bishop Street spotted a suspicious vehicle and were making checks when, around five minutes later, information was received that a device had been left at the courthouse.

""We moved immediately to begin evacuating people from nearby buildings including hundreds of hotel guests, 150 people from the Masonic Hall and a large number of children from a church youth club.

""The device detonated at 8.10pm. At this stage it appears as though the vehicle used had been hijacked from a delivery driver in the Quarry Street a short time before the explosion.

This attack was unbelievably reckless. Thankfully the attackers failed to kill or injure any members of the local community out socialising and enjoying the best of what the city has to offer.

""The people responsible for this attack have shown no regard for the community or local businesses. They care little about the damage to the area and the disruption they have caused.

""The area remains sealed off and church services at St Augustine's have been moved to St Peters and the cathedral services have been cancelled this morning as a result.

Constable Hamilton thanked the local community for its support and co-operation and asked anyone with information to contact police.

Earlier: Investigation underway after suspected car bomb attack in Derry

An investigation by the PSNI is underway after a suspected car bomb exploded in Derry last night.

The police, as well as firefighters and the ambulance service, sealed off the scene close to a courthouse on Bishop Street in the city.

Handout photo taken from the PSNI Twitter page @PSNIDCSDistrict of the scene of a suspected car bomb on Bishop Street in Derry.

Witnesses earlier said they heard a loud bang and saw a large plume of smoke, and local residents were evacuated.

There has been no reports of any casualties at this stage.

A photograph was tweeted from the PSNI Twitter account warned people to stay away from the area.

The tweet from the PSNI's Derry City and Strabane District account also warned members of the public that Bishop Street was closed, adding the words ""suspected car bomb"".

A further update was posted on the PSNI's Foyle Facebook page.

""As far as we know no one injured. There is another car we are not happy about. There are ongoing necessary evacuations.""

Tánaiste Simon Coveney tweeted his disgust at the incident.

""I utterly condemn the car bomb terrorist attack in Derry this evening,"" he said.

There is no place and no justification possible for such acts of terror, which seek to drag Northern Ireland back to violence and conflict.

Derry's SDLP mayor John Boyle challenged those responsible on what the aim was.

He said: ""I would actually like to ask the people responsible for this what it actually was that they thought they were going to achieve.

""It achieves nothing, it didn't achieve anything in the past, it didn't achieve anything right now.

""I have a question for them, what was this all about, because quite frankly this is not something that the people of this city wanted to see, it's not something they support, and as Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, I have to say I feel it incumbent upon me to speak out on behalf of the vast, vast majority of people in Derry, Strabane and indeed across this island, this is not what we want.

""This is the past and it has to stay in the past. We don't want to see any more of it.""

DUP leader Arlene Foster said it was a ""pointless act of terror"" which ""must be condemned in the strongest terms"".

""Only hurts the people of the City. Perpetrated by people with no regard for life,"" she said.

""Grateful to our emergency services for their swift actions which helped ensure there have been no fatalities or injuries.""

PSNI officers sealed off the area following the explosion (Steven McAuley/PA)

Sinn Fein Foyle MP Elisha McCallion also condemned the explosion.

""This incident has shocked the local community,"" she said. ""In particular, there are many elderly residents who live in the area who have been alarmed.

EN2718256,https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/iraq-iom-engages-government-community-actors-tackle-human-trafficking-enarku,"Baghdad – Across Iraq, the instability and insecurity caused by years of conflict have left an environment where trafficking in persons (TIP) is a constant and real threat. It occurs in peacetime and is exacerbated during conflict and post-crises. Approximately 1.6 million people in Iraq are internally displaced. The 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan estimates that 6.7 million people are still in need of humanitarian assistance. Many individuals and communities are vulnerable to human traffickers and migrant smugglers; these risks impact those communities affected by the conflict with the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), as well as migrants who have been trafficked into Iraq or are in irregular situations. Between January 2018 and July 2019, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) assisted 108 Victims of Trafficking (98 women, 10 men). Most of them were foreign nationals, reflecting the nature of cases that are referred to IOM, and most were victims of either labour or sexual exploitation. On Tuesday, World Day against Trafficking in Persons (WDATIP), the focus here was on creating an environment where government and civil-society actors could discuss pathways to combat the crime and provide meaningful protection to victims. IOM, within the framework of the Strengthening Community Policing in Iraq project, organized the technical workshop “Building Networks to Better Identify and Assist Victims of Trafficking and Other Sexual Gender-Based Violence” for criminal justice actors, service delivery providers, and community members from across Iraq. The aim of this one-day workshop (30/7) was to develop a potential procedure for security and protection actors to identify, refer and assist victims of trafficking and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) using the community policing approach. The foundation for Tuesday’s workshop was laid in Baghdad early last month, when IOM and Iraq’s Ministry of Interior organized a joint session for criminal justice actors on mainstreaming the Community Policing approach and protection principles into investigations of trafficking cases. Community Policing focuses on supporting the Ministry of Interior and rebuilding trust between law enforcement officers and communities to re-establish the rule of law and create safe and secure environments where law enforcement can better serve and protect the community. “From a judiciary perspective, there are ambiguities at the practical level in the fight against trafficking in persons. We need to have more discussions and offer concrete results in providing protection to victims, in cooperation with international organizations,” Judge Ala’a Hussein, from the Baghdad Rusafa Investigation Court, said at the time. As a direct outcome of the joint session, letters of recommendation were issued to the Higher Judicial Council suggesting waivers of fines for victims of trafficking who find themselves in irregular situations because of their trafficking experience and overstayed visas. Also, on WDATIP, IOM Iraq’s Trafficking in Persons Awareness-Raising Roadshow stopped in Erbil. Between 21 July and 21 August, IOM staff are traveling the country with representatives of the Government to conduct information sessions on trafficking in persons in selected governorates. The Iraqi Parliament passed an anti-trafficking law in 2012 that put forth punishments for both sex and labour trafficking; however, it was only adopted in the Kurdistan Region in 2018. Through activities like the roadshow and targeted trainings for law enforcement officers and community members, IOM Iraq’s Migration Management Unit (MMU) is working to ensure the law’s proper application throughout the region. “IOM lauds the Government of Iraq for paying more attention to address trafficking in persons as a form of transnational organized crime. IOM, with its strong network across Iraq, continues to support the Government of Iraq and society to combat trafficking in persons,” said IOM Iraq Chief of Mission Gerard Waite. “These methods include developing and promoting a well-planned migration strategy, providing technical assistance, and capacity development that will lead to prevention, protection of victims, and prosecution of offenders.” IOM Iraq conducts complementary counter trafficking initiatives supported by the US Government’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. These activities focus on raising awareness of TIP within at-risk communities, and training front liners to identify and safely refer victims of trafficking. IOM Iraq also provides comprehensive assistance to victims of trafficking, including items such as clothes and dignity kits, emergency cash assistance and services (legal, psychosocial and medical assistance, or assisted voluntary return and reintegration – either directly or through partners). As part of the holistic response to counter trafficking, IOM asserts government agreements in strengthening Integrated Border Management and Community Policing, including supporting initiatives towards the UN Security Council 1325 Resolution on Women Peace and Security. The project Strengthening Community Policing in Iraq is funded by the German Federal Foreign Office (FFO).

EN2496868,https://katc.com/ap-national-news/2019/03/17/the-latest-more-evacuations-in-deadly-midwestern-flooding/,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — The Latest on flooding in the Midwest (all times local): 4 p.m. Flooding in Nebraska has badly damaged up to 500 houses in one county alone. Greg London of the Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office said Sunday that one levee broke Thursday along the Platte River, and another broke Saturday. He estimates that up to 400 houses and cabins in the area known as Hanson’s Lake are damaged, including many that are completely submerged. Another 100 or so homes are damaged elsewhere in the county. The area is near where the Platte and Missouri rivers converge. A Missouri River levee nearby also breached on Thursday. London says many of the damaged homes are likely ruined. He says that while the area has had flooding before, this year’s disaster is “unprecedented.” ___ This update has been corrected to show the name of the county in Nebraska is Sarpy, not Sharpy. ___ 3:15 p.m. Flooding has reached record levels at 17 locations across Nebraska. The state’s emergency management agency says more record crests are expected in various rivers by Tuesday. Nebraska has had much of the worst of the late-winter flooding that’s been seen across the Midwest. Hundreds of homes are damaged and the state says 660 people are staying in shelters. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency says the Missouri River is expected to crest Sunday at 41 feet (12.5 meters) in Plattsmouth — 4 feet (1.22 meters) above the record set in 2011. Serious flooding there is expected to continue through next weekend. Crest records also were set along the Platte and Elkhorn rivers. The Elkhorn reached 24.6 feet (7.5 meters) Saturday in Waterloo, breaking the 1962 record by 5 1/2 feet (1.68 meters). Nearly 300 people have been rescued from high water across the state. At least one person has died in floodwaters in the state. A second death from flooding was reported in Iowa. ___ 3 p.m. Officials say residents of Green Bay, Wisconsin, who evacuated their homes due to flooding can return. Heavy rainfall and melting snow have led to dangerously high water in creeks and rivers across several Midwestern states. Even as the water receded in Green Bay, other parts of the Midwest are still under water or are bracing for flooding. In far southwestern Iowa, residents were being evacuated Sunday as floodwaters overtopped levees. And in St. Joseph, Missouri, volunteers are filling sandbags to help secure a levee protecting an industrial area. Green Bay Metro Fire Department lifted its emergency evacuation order at 10 a.m. Sunday for an eight- to 10-block area around the East River. The Green Bay Press Gazette reports city inspectors were out placing placards on front doors identifying those not currently inhabitable because they have no heat and those that are safe to re-enter. ___ 1:55 p.m. Flooding along the Missouri River is causing long delays for Amtrak passengers. The passenger rail service said Sunday that its Missouri River Runner service between St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, will have delays up to five hours because of flooding and rail congestion. Amtrak says all Missouri River Runner trains will be canceled Monday. The service typically travels twice daily between Missouri’s two metropolitan areas. ___ 12:40 p.m. The flooding Missouri River has damaged dozens of buildings at an Air Force base in Nebraska. The Omaha World-Herald reports that about one-third of the Offutt Air Force Base is under water. A spokeswoman for the base says 60 buildings, mostly on the south end of the base, have been damaged, including about 30 completely inundated with as much as 8 feet (2.4 meters) of water. Among the buildings badly damaged are the headquarters building and a hangar. Offutt’s lone runway is expected to remain closed until Tuesday afternoon. Airmen had been filling thousands of sandbags, but the newspaper reports that the sandbagging effort has been halted. ___ 11:40 a.m. Residents in parts of southwestern Iowa are being urged to leave their homes as a torrent of Missouri River water flows over and through levees. Heavy rainfall and snowmelt forced river levels across four Midwestern states to dangerous levels. Two deaths were blamed on the high and forceful water, and two other men have been missing for days. While river levels on Sunday were starting to level off in Nebraska, residents in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri were bracing for the worst still yet to come. Flooding has also been reported in Illinois, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The Missouri River reached a record 30.2 feet (9.2 meters) Sunday in Fremont County, Iowa, in the state’s far southwestern corner. People in parts of Bartlett and Thurman were being evacuated as water broke through or overtopped levees. County Emergency Management Director Mike Crecelius says it isn’t just the amount of water, it’s the swiftness of the current that creates a danger. ___ 11:20 a.m. Flooding caused by heavy rain and snowmelt is blamed for two deaths in the Midwest, and two others are missing. Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes in Nebraska and Iowa as levees succumbed to the rush of water. Flooding has also been reported in Illinois, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Authorities say 52-year-old Aleido Rojas Galan of Norfolk, Nebraska, died Friday night in southwestern Iowa. Officials say Galan and two others were in a vehicle that drove around a barricade and was swept away. The other two men survived. On Thursday, 50-year-old James Wilke of Columbus, Nebraska, died when a bridge collapsed as he used a tractor to try and reach stranded motorists. A Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away. Water also swept away a man after a dam collapse. Both men are still missing.",2019-03-17

EN2626141,https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/2019/06/09/accused-is-hostage-keepers-will-have-to-face-me-in-court-victims-daughter/,"The daughter of aid worker David Haines, who was murdered by Islamic State extremists, has said she plans to face his accused captors in court. Bethany Haines told ITV News she believes “justice will be served” when suspected terrorists Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh go on trial. Kotey and Elsheikh are accused of belonging to a brutal four-man cell of Islamic State executioners in Syria, nicknamed The Beatles because of their British accents, responsible for killing a number of high-profile Western hostages. It is thought they may go on trial in the US after they were stripped of their British citizenship and the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them in the UK. Speaking to ITV News’ security editor, Rohit Kachroo, Miss Haines said: “When they go on trial, they’ll face a tough sentence. They’ll also have to face me sitting in the courtroom. “Whether he will reveal the truth or not is kind of up to him. “I think, for myself, I tend not to think about him, I tend not to think about Jihadi John, I tend not to think about Elsheikh. “They did what they did and justice will be served. “But, for me, I don’t speak about them, I don’t want to think about them, I don’t want to give them any ammunition or support for them to be martyrs. “They can do what they want to do but their actions have consequences.” Kotey and Elsheikh, who were raised in the UK, were captured in January last year and are believed to be detained by Kurdish forces in Syria. Their capture sparked a row over whether they should be returned to the UK for trial or face justice in another jurisdiction and Home Secretary Sajid Javid faced criticism after sharing intelligence about them with US authorities, without seeking assurances that they would not face execution if they were extradited and tried there. Last month, Kotey admitted that he was a hostage keeper with the IS terror cell, which also included Mohammed Emwazi – known as Jihadi John – who was killed in a US air strike in 2015, and Aine Davis, who has been jailed in Turkey. Kotey was part of the same IS cell as Mohammed Emwazi – known as Jihadi John (PA) The group is suspected of involvement in the beheading of 27 people, including British aid workers Mr Haines and Alan Henning and US citizens James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig. Mr Haines was beheaded in 2014 after being taken hostage in Syria while working for an international relief agency. The 44-year-old father-of-two had been helping refugees in a camp near the Turkish border when he was snatched by militants. His daughter said she will “do anything” to find her father’s remains. She said: “If it means going over there, I’ll go over there. If it means speaking to a hundred different people, I’ll speak to a hundred different people. “I will get him home if it can be done.”",2019-06-10

EN2404438,https://www.esi-africa.com/world-bank-group-president-kim-to-join-private-sector/,"With three years left of his tenure, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim has announced that he will be stepping down from his position to join the private sector as of 1 February.

“It has been a great honor to serve as President of this remarkable institution, full of passionate individuals dedicated to the mission of ending extreme poverty in our lifetime,” said Kim.

He added: “The work of the World Bank Group is more important now than ever as the aspirations of the poor rise all over the world, and problems like climate change, pandemics, famine and refugees continue to grow in both their scale and complexity. Serving as President and helping position the institution squarely in the middle of all these challenges has been a great privilege.”

Kim will be joining a firm to focus on increasing infrastructure investments in developing countries. The details of this new position will be announced shortly.

In addition to working on infrastructure investments, Kim announced that he will also be re-joining the board of Partners In Health (PIH), an organization he co-founded more than 30 years ago.

“I look forward to working once again with my longtime friends and colleagues at PIH on a range of issues in global health and education. I will also continue my engagement with Brown University as a trustee of the Corporation and look forward to serving as a Senior Fellow at Brown’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs,” Kim said.

Highlighting the positive impact that Kim’s leadership has had on the Group, the Bank said the institution in 2012 established two goals: to end extreme poverty by 2030; and to boost shared prosperity, focusing on the bottom 40% of the population in developing countries. These goals now guide and inform the institution in its daily work around the globe.

In addition, shareholders strongly supported measures to ensure that the Bank Group be even better positioned to respond to the development needs of clients:

The Bank Group’s Fund for the Poorest, IDA, achieved two successive, record replenishments, which enabled the institution to increase its work in areas suffering from fragility, conflict, and violence.

In April 2018, the Bank Group’s Governors overwhelmingly approved a historic $13 billion capital increase for IBRD and IFC that will allow the Bank Group to support countries in reaching their development goals while responding to crises such as climate change, pandemics, fragility, and underinvestment in human capital around the world.

Over the past 6+ years, the institutions of the World Bank Group have provided financing at levels never seen outside of a financial crisis.

Recognising the power of capital markets to transform development finance, the Bank Group during Kim’s tenure also launched several new innovative financial instruments, including facilities to address infrastructure needs, prevent pandemics, and help the millions of people forcibly displaced from their homes by climate shocks, conflict, and violence. The Bank is also working with the United Nations and leading technology companies to implement the Famine Action Mechanism, to detect warning signs earlier and prevent famines before they begin.

During his term, President Kim emphasised that one of the greatest needs in the developing world is infrastructure finance, and he pushed the Bank Group to maximise finance for development by working with a new cadre of private sector partners committed to building sustainable, climate-smart infrastructure in developing countries.

EN2427902,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2019/01/24/aid-curbs-in-myanmars-rakhine-impact-at-least-50000-people/,"YANGON: New government curbs on aid activities in Myanmar’s western Rakhine State “are affecting at least 50,000 people”, the United Nations has said in an internal note, highlighting the growing impact of recent fighting on the civilian population.

The Rakhine State government this month blocked non-governmental organisations and UN agencies from travelling to rural areas in five townships in northern and central parts of the state affected by conflict.

The International Committee of the Red Cross and UN World Food Programme were exempted from the ban on aid activity in the region, where fighting between government troops and autonomy-seeking ethnic Rakhine rebels has displaced thousands.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) summarized recent information gathered from aid organisations on the impact of the restrictions in the two central Rakhine townships of Kyauktaw and Ponnagyun.

UNOCHA circulated a note on the findings late on Wednesday to some UN officials and non-governmental organisations seeking comments and updates on the situation. Reuters obtained the note independently and reviewed it on Thursday.

It said that the restrictions forced aid organisations to reduce or stop pre-existing programmes, including the provision of healthcare, clean water, school construction and teacher training, among other activities.

For example, the agency said that in Kyauktaw “mobile health services were to be provided in 15 villages, totalling around 17,000 people, involving around 1,600 people to be treated on average each month … the provision of these services has now been put on hold”.

The affected activities included primary health care and malnutrition screening and treatment, it said.

“In Ponnagyun, around 220 health consultations in rural areas of the township have been stopped, including emergency referral services,” the agency said in the note.

Fighting has forced about 5,000 people to flee from their homes and to take shelter in monasteries and communal areas across the region since early January, according to UNOCHA.

Myanmar’s president, speaking in a rare meeting with the commander-in-chief this month, urged the military to “crush” the rebels of the Arakan Army. The president, Win Myint, is a loyalist of the de facto government leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

Last week, the United Nations called on the government to allow “rapid and unimpeded” humanitarian access to the area.

“We are currently working to assess the impact that recent access restrictions could have on the delivery of pre-existing and ongoing humanitarian programmes in the affected townships,” said Pierre Peron, UNOCHA’s spokesman in Myanmar in response to an email seeking comment on the internal note.

“This is an evolving assessment.”

He said the United Nations was “liaising closely with the authorities in Rakhine State, who have now invited humanitarian organizations to individually apply for travel authorisations for specific activities”, adding he hoped authorities would respond “quickly and positively” to such applications.

Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not respond to calls seeking comment.

Ready to respond

The Rakhine municipal affairs minister, Win Myint, could not be reached for comment. He told Reuters earlier the restrictions had been put in place for “security reasons” and he did not know when they would be lifted.

Reuters contacted several affected NGOs seeking comment on the situation. One of them, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), said, “Along with most other organisations we do not currently have access to respond to the needs of the conflict-affected and displaced populations”.

“We have emergency supplies prepositioned and remain ready to respond if this situation changes,” said Laura Marshall, the NRC’s acting country director.

The affected aid groups published a statement on Tuesday expressing “deep concern” about the restrictions.

Rakhine State has been roiled by successive rounds of violence in recent years.

In 2017, an extensive military crackdown, following attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents, prompted about 730,000 Rohingya to flee westwards into neighbouring Bangladesh.

The Arakan Army, the group behind the recent fighting, is demanding greater autonomy from the central government for the state, where the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine people form the majority of the population.

Arakan Army fighters killed 13 policemen and wounded nine in attacks on four police posts in early January, state media reported.

An Arakan Army spokesman outside Myanmar told Reuters the group attacked the security forces in response to a broad military offensive in the north of Rakhine that also targeted civilians.

EN2727038,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/germanys-workers-feel-impact-trade-040010767.html,"Germany's Workers Are About to Feel the Impact of the Trade Storm (Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. The global trade storm battering manufacturing in Europe’s largest economy is about to reach the labor market. German joblessness, which declined from one record low to the next for much of the past decade, is no longer falling and risks a reversal as workers endure the repercussions of the country’s factory slump. Production data for June on Wednesday showed the worst annual drop since 2009, and industry surveys show a feeble outlook for employment. The European Central Bank is counting on private spending and investment to sustain growth and lift prices in Germany and the rest of the euro area as exports suffer from the deteriorating trade environment. Policy makers are concerned enough to be preparing fresh stimulus for as soon as next month. While headline jobs numbers from Germany aren’t yet alarming -- the number of people out of work rose by only 1,000 in July -- below the surface, labor demand is softening, employers are switching to more short-time arrangements, and vulnerable parts of society are starting to feel the pain. “The phase of continuous improvement in the labor market is behind us,” said Stefan Kipar, an economist at BayernLB in Munich. “What’s very clear is that companies are no longer adding jobs.” Some, in fact, are planning to shrink their workforce, with Continental AG -- a bellwether of the country’s export-reliant car industry -- joining companies including BASF SE and Siemens AG in announcing reductions. Adecco Group AG, the world’s largest employment agency, said on Thursday that its revenues were weighed down by slower growth in Europe, including Germany. “It is clear that we see a continued weakness in manufacturing and automotive sectors,” Alain Dehaze, its chief executive officer, told Bloomberg Television. “The deceleration in Europe is there.” Germany’s labor agency, based in Nuremberg, sees economic downturns typically affecting early labor-market indicators in five steps. Registered vacancies are usually the first to decline when demand softens, followed by diminished use of temporary employment. Both of those indicators have been weakening this year. Receding contract work particularly hurts more vulnerable job seekers, as it’s often an entry into the labor market for people lacking qualifications. Roughly one in three unemployed refugees, for instance, eventually lands a temporary job. But it’s also the easiest avenue for companies to lay off staff that’s no longer needed. The next gauge to react, according to the labor agency, is the number of employees whose working hours are cut to reduce costs during periods of weaker demand. The German government makes up for lost wages when this occurs, albeit not in full. The upshot for workers is they can keep their jobs; the downside is lower overall pay. Companies must first file a notice with the labor agency when they plan such arrangements. Compared to a year ago, both notices and realized short-time work have increased. Unemployment benefits are another area to watch. As employment terminations rise and the chances of finding a job decline, the total amount of people receiving payments from the government rises. That number has grown by 33,000 people -- or 5% -- from a year ago. The labor agency sees one additional area of weakness. Unemployment within helper jobs -- or those suitable to workers with lower qualifications than needed for professional or expert positions -- is rising more than usual for the time of year. It’s the area with the fewest vacancies relative to the number of jobless people looking for such work. Despite all those warning signals, the labor agency isn’t yet sounding the alarm. Employment continues to be strong, according to board member Daniel Terzenbach, in large part because skilled employees have become scarce and companies are still reluctant to dismiss them over what might turn out to be a temporary problem. German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged last month that the economic slowdown justified efforts to prop up domestic demand, but offered few new measures to provide an extra jolt. A change in tune may be coming soon. Economists including Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING-Diba AG in Frankfurt, say it’ll just be a matter of time before the factory slump hits home.

Flames and smoke rise from a fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 15, 2019. Photo: Bloomberg Photo By Martin Barzilai. Photo: Bloomberg Photo By Martin Barzilai. Image 1 of / 8 Caption Close Macron presides over rare unity as France grieves Notre Dame 1 / 8 Back to Gallery French citizens joined global leaders to rally behind Emmanuel Macron in the aftermath of a fire that ravaged the iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, giving the French President an opportunity to quell the political volatility that's embroiled his government. Macron vowed on Monday night to rebuild the 850-year-old Gothic monument, an issue that's united the French population across the political spectrum, with national parties suspending their European election campaigns and leaders from around the globe lending their support. The fire prompted the cancellation of a planned speech by the 41-year-old leader meant to allay the concerns of citizens angered over economic disparities and by a lack of trust in the political system. The address was an effort to move past months of protests by the Yellow Vests movement and bolster Macron's popularity, which had taken a battering from a public perception that he's out of touch and that his policies favor the rich. ""This is an opportunity for Macron to reach out to the opposition to create unity in a fractured, divided nation,"" said Bruno Cautres, a politics professor at Sciences Po institute, who cycles past the landmark every morning. ""He can't be seen as using this moment of widespread grief, but at the same time, people will expect all politicians to start working together, first for Notre Dame and hopefully, beyond Notre Dame."" The fire raged for about 12 hours, taking with it about two-thirds of the roof and its spire, and at one point late Monday night even the stone structure of the monument was at risk. The cause of the fire is still unknown but Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said nothing indicates it was started deliberately. Paris prosecutors opened a non-criminal investigation, a common step in such a major incident. The entire structure was a half-hour away from collapsing before firemen prevented the blaze from engulfing the bell towers, according to Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez. Culture Minister Franck Riester said major treasures such as the ""Crown of Thorns"" and Louis IX's tunic were removed to City Hall, while other relics were taken to the Louvre. The altars weren't burned but will be removed to be treated for smoke damage, while the rose windows appeared to have escaped major damage, he said. The initial budget to restore the cathedral before the fire was about 150 million euros ($170 million), and may need to be increased to about 450 million euros now, according to Michel Picaud, president of the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris. Money has already started to arrive for a rebuilding that will take years if not decades. The Paris region has unblocked 10 million euros ($11.5 million) in emergency funding. The Pinault family of Gucci owner Kering SA announced it was giving 100 million euros and the Arnault family that controls LVMH said it pledged 200 million euros. In his canceled speech, Macron had been expected to announce middle class income tax cuts, indexation of small pensions and the abolition of the elite ENA school for civil servants, in an effort to assuage grassroots discontent, French media reported. The fire comes a a little over a month before France is due to elect its members of the European Parliament. According to Ifop's daily rolling poll, Macron's La Republique en Marche! party and Marine Le Pen's euro-skeptic National Rally are tied at 21.5 percent, with the Republicans in third place at 13 percent. In the latest Ipsos poll, Macron's approval rating fell 1 point to 27 percent. In the week leading up to Monday, political leaders from opposition parties were on television saying Macron's measures wouldn't be up to the task, even without knowing what he was due to announce. Hours later they were all expressing their sadness at France's incalculable artistic loss. ""For two years, all we've had are tortured words that go around in circles, and when we get to the finish line there's nothing there,"" Laurent Wauquiez, head of The Republicans, the largest opposition party in Parliament, said Sunday on BFM TV. Monday night he wrote on Twitter that ""it's a whole part of our history, of all of us, that burns tonight."" He canceled an EU election rally he was due to attend in the southern city of Nimes Tuesday night. Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party and one of Macron's most scathing critics, said ""This building is like a member of our family. For at least 24 hours I can't feel and act like a politician."" Macron will have to walk a fine line, and tragic incidents throughout Europe have proven to be pitfalls for leaders who miscalculated the political severity of the events. British Prime Minister Theresa May had to admit that her initial handling of the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire, which killed at least 80 people in a London apartment block, was ""not good enough"" because she hadn't met victims on her first visit. Francois Hollande, who was president in 2015 when a terrorist rampage left 12 dead in France, saw his flagging popularity revive after the incident. Hollande oversaw a manhunt and brought international statesmen and millions of voters together in a show of political force, which earned him a temporary boost in his approval ratings. Leaders from around the world expressed their solidarity with Paris, including Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Macron will speak later Tuesday with Pope Francis, after having talked earlier with U.S. President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, whose populist government has been at odds with Macron, reached across the political divide. ""A thought and a hug for the people of Paris,"" Salvini wrote on Twitter. ""From Italy, all of our friendship and all the help we can give.""",2019-04-16

In an interview with BFM television, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said that a handful of French jihadis had already returned and more would follow soon. Neither he nor France's foreign ministry confirmed BFM's report that as many as 130 could come back within weeks. ""The Americans are leaving Syria. It's important to keep that in mind,"" Castaner said. ""There are a certain number who are imprisoned because the Americans are there, and they will be freed. They will want to return to France."" The question of what to do with foreigners who joined the Islamic State group has grown increasingly thorny as the U.S. departure looms. French jihadis made up the largest contingent of European recruits, and in 2015 and 2016 an Islamic State cell of French and Belgian fighters who sneaked in from Turkey attacked Paris and Brussels. Britain refuses to take back citizens who joined the group and has stripped their citizenship. Other European countries have remained largely silent about the fate of men and women whom many see as a security threat. ""These are people who have voluntarily joined a terrorist organization ... that has committed attacks in France and continues to threaten us,"" France's foreign ministry said. Castaner said all would be jailed immediately in France and face trial, but declined to provide details. Kurdish authorities in Syria have detained 900 foreign members of the group, and 4,000 family of IS members, according to Ilham Ahmed, a senior Syrian Kurdish official. Russia has taken some of the recruits back and jailed them. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there are at least 78 French women and children who had recently come out of the last stronghold of IS in eastern Syria. This is in addition to another 65 previously evacuated from other IS held areas and in Kurdish custody. It was not clear if Castaner was also speaking of civilians and families of IS members. Castaner said a small number had already returned to France, although it's not clear whether they had voluntarily surrendered or were repatriated, or whether he meant fighters or their families. In April, then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said French special forces had joined American troops in Syria. ___ Sarah El Deeb contributed from Beirut. Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

EN2671590,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/texas/article/In-border-crisis-pregnant-teens-are-especially-14071707.php,"PHOENIX (AP) — As tales of wretchedness and overcrowding in government border detention facilities abound, one group of migrants is particularly vulnerable: teen moms and pregnant girls without parents of their own. Immigrant advocates and lawyers say the young mothers don't get special medical consideration while they're being crammed into U.S. facilities so packed that migrants are forced to sleep on floors or stand for days on end. As a result, the girls say they're underfed, have poor hygiene and their babies get sick. Their hardships aren't over once they're released, which can't happen until a vetted sponsor — usually a relative — takes them in as their immigration cases wind their way through the courts. Their lack of legal status and inability to afford child care makes it nearly impossible for them to find a job, and staying in the U.S. legally is an uphill battle even if their children are American citizens. ""The average unaccompanied minor who's coming is facing so many challenges because of lack of access to legal representation, issues in education, lack of support, lack of mental health treatment,"" said Priya Konings, the deputy director of legal services for Kids in Need of Defense, which helps unaccompanied minors. ""When you compound that with anything else such as being a young parent or being pregnant, everything becomes twice as hard."" An attorney's shocking discovery last month of an ailing 17-year-old girl from Guatemala cradling a clearly premature infant inside a U.S. detention center prompted a national outcry and highlighted the challenges facing the teens. The mother had had an emergency cesarean section in Mexico in early May and crossed the border with the baby on June 4. She was in a wheelchair in extreme pain when legal advocates found her. The girl and her baby are now doing well after leaving the processing facility in McAllen, Texas, where they were held, said her attorney, Hope Frye. ""The place where they are, it's safe and the baby is the belle of the ball,"" Frye said. The accounts from lawyers and advocates come as U.S. immigration agencies have been struggling to handle a growing influx of migrants who cross illegally from Mexico and end up in the facilities of the ill-prepared and increasingly overwhelmed Customs and Border Protection, the first agency in charge of their detention. CBP is supposed to release the unaccompanied children to Health and Human Services — which contracts with shelter providers — within 72 hours, but the overcrowding has created a backlog that has resulted in children sometimes spending weeks in the custody of the CBP. Customs and Border Protection has said repeatedly that it is not equipped to handle the large number of families and unaccompanied children coming to the border, and says its agents aren't trained to be caregivers. When asked to comment on the treatment of pregnant teens and teens with babies, a spokesman pointed to the agency's guidebook on treatment of detainees, which says underage migrants and those who are pregnant or nursing must have regular access to snacks, milk and juice. The conditions have prompted protests such as one Thursday in Philadelphia in which about 300 people demonstrated outside the building housing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office. Police say some members briefly interrupted the Salute to America parade and 33 were detained and cited. Organizer Sarah Giskin said earlier that protesters were demanding closure of border detention centers and abolition of the ICE agency. The number of unaccompanied minors who travel to the U.S. has grown over the last year. Customs and Border Protection apprehended over 56,200 unaccompanied youths in the Southwest border from October to the end of May, compared to 50,000 in the last fiscal year. It's not known how many were pregnant or had babies. But the HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement says the agency has had about 500 teens with babies in its custody since October. The trip to the U.S. can be particularly dangerous for pregnant teens, said Nicole Ramos, refugee program director for Al Otro Lado, an organization that helps asylum seekers. ""I feel young pregnant girls are vulnerable to human trafficking. They don't have resources. They're kids, so they're not savvy in all the ways of the world,"" Ramos said. A series of reports and federal court documents have shown that their tribulations don't end once they are in U.S. custody. Two reports by U.S. government inspectors found severe and dangerous overcrowding at Border Patrol holding facilities in El Paso and McAllen, Texas. In interviews with attorneys last month, young mothers who were being held in several Texas border facilities as unaccompanied minors described feeling hungry, cold and terrified because their babies were sick. A 17-year-old Honduran girl with a 1-year-old daughter said she was detained for weeks at the processing center in McAllen after crossing the border on May 29. The girl told a lawyer she was separated from her husband and put in an area so crowded that some people had to sleep sitting up. The girl said she was allowed to shower once when they were detained but had not been able to again in the 12 days since, and her baby's clothing was dirty with vomit. ""We are given sandwiches that are cold and raw, and so we don't eat them,"" the girl said. In a separate interview, a 16-year-old Guatemalan girl with a 1-year-old son who spent at least two weeks in CBP custody told an attorney she and her child were not eating properly. ""Before we came here my baby was eating solid food three times a day but now he is only getting breast milk and sometimes a cookie. I'm only making a little breast milk because I am not eating or drinking enough,"" the girl said. Once they're released, the young mothers face a whole new set of challenges, said Konings, of Kids in Need of Defense. Minors don't automatically get legal representation in immigration court because it's considered civil, not criminal. They often have no access to mental health treatment. And though U.S.-born children qualify for welfare services, their mothers are usually afraid to ask for it for fear it might negatively affect their immigration case. Young mothers also have a hard time finding work while also caring for a child, and can't make ends meet, Konings said. Having an American-born child also does not guarantee the parent can stay in the country legally, Konings said. A U.S. citizen has to be 21 years old before he or she can sponsor a parent. And even then, parents found living in the U.S. illegally are banned from returning to America for 10 years. ""The whole concept of, 'Oh I'll just have a baby in the U.S.' I mean that's not a thing,"" Konings said. ""You're talking about 31 years. That's just not reality."" ___ Associated Press writer Amy Taxin in Santa Ana, California, contributed to this report.",2019-07-04

(AP) — The Latest on an overturned cargo ship off the coast of Georgia (all times local): 6:10 p.m. The fourth and last crew member trapped inside a capsized cargo ship off the coast of Georgia has been rescued. Coast Guard Lt. Lloyd Heflin told The Associated Press in a text message that the South Korean crew member was rescued just before 6 p.m. Monday. He says the crew member appears to be in good medical condition but is being evaluated. Three other crew members were rescued earlier Monday from the Golden Ray. ___ 4 p.m. U.S. Coast Guard officials say they have rescued three of four crew members from an overturned cargo ship off the coast of Georgia, but they're still working on a plan to rescue a fourth crew member trapped on another deck. Capt. John Reed says at least two of the South Korean men who were extracted from a hole drilled in the hull of Golden Ray were able to walk with assistance down to a waiting boat. All three are being examined by medical personnel. Reed says the three men have seen the fourth person, who is trapped behind glass in the ship's engineering compartment. He says marine engineers are working on a plan to get him out. The rescue came 36 hours after the Golden Ray flipped onto its side and caught fire Sunday as it left Brunswick, Georgia, with more than 4,000 vehicles inside. ___ 3:15 p.m. The U.S. Coast Guard says it has rescued two of four trapped crew members from an overturned cargo ship off the coast of Georgia. Lt. Lloyd Heflin tells The Associated Press in a text message that two men have been extracted and rescuers are working on extracting a third. Heflin said the four South Koreans who were trapped aboard the Golden Ray are in the propeller shaft room near the stern of the ship and that rescuers cut into the hull there to pull them out. Responders made contact with crew members Monday morning, more than 24 hours after the vehicle carrier overturned while leaving a port call in Brunswick, Georgia. The Golden Ray flipped onto its side and caught fire Sunday as it left Brunswick with more than 4,000 vehicles inside. 1:20 p.m. The U.S. Coast Guard says it's developing a plan to extract four South Korean crew members trapped inside a cargo ship turned on its side off the coast of Georgia. Coast Guard Southeast says on Twitter that ""this is a slow, but safe process"" and that rescuers will deliver supplies through a hole drilled in the upturned hull of the Golden Ray. Lt. Lloyd Heflin told The Associated Press that responders made contact with crew members Monday morning, more than 24 hours after the vehicle carrier overturned while leaving a port call in Brunswick, Georgia. The Golden Ray flipped onto its side and caught fire Sunday as it left Brunswick with more than 4,000 vehicles inside. South Korea's Foreign Ministry has said the four crew members were in the engine room of the ship. ___ 11 a.m. The U.S. Coast Guard says rescuers have drilled through the hull of an overturned cargo ship and made contact with four missing crew members stuck inside. Lt. Lloyd Heflin tells The Associated Press that the contact came Monday morning after rescuers rappelled down the side of the ship. Heflin says ""the early indication is they are on board and OK."" He says the initial rescue team has faced a language barrier in communicating with the South Korean crew members. Heflin says rescuers are trying to figure out the safest way of getting them out. The Golden Ray flipped onto its side and caught fire Sunday as it left the Port of Brunswick with more than 4,000 vehicles inside. ___ 10:20 a.m. South Korea's Foreign Ministry says four crew members are in the engine room of their overturned cargo ship awaiting help from a U.S. Coast Guard rescue team. The foreign ministry's statement also says the fire that prevented a rescue attempt is now extinguished. Coast Guard Lt. Kit Pace said Monday that rescuers have been able to board the ship. The statement says 10 South Koreans, 13 Filipinos were on board, along with a U.S. harbor pilot, when the Golden Ray began tilting over in the shipping channel. The Hyundai Glovis company uses Georgia's Port of Brunswick to ship Kia and Hyundai vehicles along with other cars. The U.S. Coast Guard rescued 20 people but the fire and the instability of the overturned vessel kept them from venturing deep inside. The ministry statement said some of the missing South Koreans ""apparently tapped back three times"" after Coast Guard staff tapped on the hull. A Coast Guard spokesman told The Associated Press on Monday that rescuers heard noises but can't confirm they were signs of life without getting inside the overturned ship. ___ 9:55 a.m. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter has landed on the side of an overturned cargo ship off the Georgia coast, as the search for four missing crew members continues. The helicopter landed around 9 a.m. Monday on the hull of the Golden Ray, which rolled over Sunday in St. Simons Sound as it left the Port of Brunswick with a load of vehicles headed for Baltimore. Petty Officer 3rd class Ryan Dickinson told The Associated Press on Monday that rescuers heard noises but can't confirm that they're signs of life without going inside. The Coast Guard and others rescued 20 people from the ship early Sunday before fires and unstable cargo made it too risky to go inside. The ship is owned by South Korean firm Hyundai Glovis, which carries cars for automakers Hyundai and Kia as well as others. ____ 8:15 a.m. The U.S. Coast Guard says rescuers have heard noises from inside a cargo ship where four crew members are unaccounted for after their huge vessel overturned and caught fire off Georgia's coast. Petty Officer 3rd class Ryan Dickinson told The Associated Press on Monday that rescuers heard noises but can't confirm that they're signs of life without going inside. The flames and smoke have prevented rescuers from safely penetrating the unstable vessel. The Golden Ray rolled over early Sunday in St. Simons Sound as it left the Port of Brunswick with a load of cars for Baltimore. Coast Guard Capt. John Reed said 20 people were evacuated before the fires and unstable cargo made it too risky to go inside.",2019-09-09

HOMICIDE VICTIM The eldest brother of homicide victim Chynna Deese says he's not expecting the criminal investigation to provide a definitive answer as to why she was killed in such a seemingly random act. The RCMP has promised to release details in the coming weeks of its investigative conclusions in the case that sparked a manhunt across Western Canada. Mounties have already said they believe Bryer Schmegelsky and Kam McLeod were suspects in the deaths of Deese, her Australian boyfriend Lucas Fowler and Leonard Dyck of Vancouver. Thirty-year-old Stetson Deese says Mounties maintain regular contact with his family, but they haven't been told much beyond what has been announced publicly. ——— CANADA TO SEND MILITARY PLANE TO UGANDA Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan is expected to announce today the long-awaited deployment of a promised Canadian Forces transport plane to Uganda for peacekeeping missions. The CC-130 Hercules was one of three signature promises Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made to the United Nations when Canada hosted a major peacekeeping summit in November 2017, only one of which has been fulfilled. The federal government last year deployed a unit of helicopters and several hundred military personnel to help with medical evacuations in Mali. That mission is to wrap up at the end of this month. Trudeau also promised a 200-strong ""quick reaction force"" to the UN, but Canada has yet to register the force in a UN database of peacekeeping pledges, which means it has not been formally offered. ——— NEW REFUGEE GUIDELINES UNFAIR TO SOME: NDP NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan says she is dismayed by newly published guidelines for asylum seekers who fall under a controversial new admissibility law — guidelines she believes show some refugees will not get a fair chance to plead their case for protection in Canada. The guidelines say refugees subject to the new law cannot use their oral hearings to make legal representations or present arguments, but can only lay out facts of their case and answer questions. Legal arguments and testimony from witnesses supporting their refugee claims can only be submitted in writing. Kwan is accusing Border Security Minister Bill Blair of misleading Canadians when he said publicly in the spring that asylum seekers would have access to a full oral hearing. ——— CANADA APOLOGIZES FOR SLED DOG KILLINGS The Canadian government has apologized for the killings of thousands of sled dogs decades ago. Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett delivered the apology in Iqaluit. She says the government made a mistake by assuming it knew what was best for Inuit people. Between 1950 and 1975, Inuit in Nunuvut's Baffin region were moved from mobile camps to permanent communities. Sled dogs proved a hazard in the communities and the government required owners to muzzle and chain the animals. An inquiry report in 2010 found that it became easier for authorities to shoot the dogs instead of enforcing the ordinances. ——— ALSO IN THE NEWS: — Federal Gender Equality Minister Maryam Monsef and Edmonton MP Randy Boissonnault will make an announcement today in support of LGBTQ2 organizations in Canada. — The trial continues today for Aluma Systems Inc., charged under the Occupational Health and Safety Act after an ammonia leak at CF Industries left one worker dead and another injured in 2015. — The University of Alberta and the University of California, San Francisco are teaming up to start the world's first open data commons for preclinical Spinal Cord Injury research.",2019-08-21

In the article ""Trump Admin Works With Mexico To Align On Asylum – US Citizens Get Shafted"" at Freedom Outpost, Trump administration officials stated they were working with Mexico on a ""safe third country"" asylum ""deal"" to stem the tide of illegal alien invasion in the united States. President Trump has proposed imposing tariffs on Mexico in order to coerce the lawless nation into assisting the US in securing its borders by enforcing current Mexican immigration and asylum laws. Mexico has fired back, issuing what Ildefonso Ortiz and Brendan Darby at Breitbart News term a ""veiled threat"", claiming without the Mexican government's assistance 250,000 more Central American migrants would be crossing in the united States. Breitbart News reported: Mexico’s top diplomats issued a veiled threat to the U.S. government suggesting that without their efforts, 250,000 more Central American migrants could proceed north. The statement follows President Donald Trump’s threat of raising a 5 percent tariff if Mexico does not strengthen its borders. Latest: ""Decimated"" Islamic State Plotted To Smuggle Islamic Terrorists Into US Via Southern Border On Monday evening, Mexico’s Foreign Relations Secretariat posted a statement claiming the country was effectively providing humanitarian visas to Central American migrants and strengthening immigration enforcement operations in southern Mexico. take our poll - story continues below Do you support President Trump's plan to impose tariffs on Mexico?

The veiled threat was buried at in the middle of a document where Mexican officials claimed to have deported more than 80,000 migrants and arrested 400 suspected smugglers in conjunction with U.S. officials. As Breitbart News reported, U.S. immigration authorities are apprehending record-setting groups of migrants in a trend that is expected to reach more than 1 million persons by the end of fiscal year 2019. In recent months, Mexican officials have provided buses and security for thousands of migrants moving to the U.S. border with increasing efficiency. In February, the border state of Coahuila provided 49 buses to move nearly 2,000 migrants to Piedras Negras, where the migrants expected to cross into Texas and request asylum. The US would only receive those additional illegal alien invaders because federal government officials refuse to enforce vigorously our immigration laws, close ""asylum"" loopholes, and call up the citizen militia to repel this invasion, using whatever force is necessary. If anyone knows history, an agreement isn't worth the paper it's written on when one of the parties refuses to honor the agreement. It happened with an agreement between Stalin and Hitler, where Hitler unilaterally decided to invade Russia instead of honoring the non-aggression agreement Germany had with Russia. It happened with an agreement between Hitler and the United Kingdom's Neville Chamberlain. Mexico is a lawless, corrupt, cartel controlled nation that may or may not honor any agreement that does not benefit it in some way. After all, Mexico has been helping illegal alien invaders cross their country to enter the united States in violation of an agreement on asylum with the United Nations. While this writer has maintained that a ""safe third country"" agreement with Mexico will not stop the entry of illegal alien invaders into the US for multiple reasons, Kris Kobach, writing for Breitbart News, expresses a differing opinion. Kobach, General Counsel of We Build the Wall and immigration policy expert, wrote: The President said that the tariffs will be remain in place unless and until “Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory.” What that means is open to debate; and it was probably intentionally left vague. But there is no doubt what it should mean. Mexico must immediately sign a “safe third country” agreement with the United States, similar to our agreement with Canada. This would require asylum applicants to file their asylum application in the first safe country they set foot in (so applicants in the caravans from Central America would have to seek asylum in Mexico, rather than the United States). In announcing the tariffs, President Trump suggested that Mexico should also start enforcing its own immigration laws against the migrants who illegally cross through Mexico en route to the United States. He is absolutely right. Mexico should arrest and deport those migrants back to their home countries in Central America, rather than simply encouraging them to continue north to the United States. But that’s not enough. It doesn’t address the incentives that induce the Central Americans to illegally migrate to the United States in the first place. Perhaps the biggest incentive is the breakdown of our asylum system caused by the flood of illegal aliens who have no valid claim to asylum. As I have previously written, they come to the United States, make a bogus claim of asylum based on poverty or crime (rather than a valid claim based on persecution by their government), and enjoy a six-year delay in the United States until their asylum hearing. A safe third country agreement would solve the problem. And it would be easy for Mexico to do, at little cost to them. Forced to make their asylum claim in Mexico rather than the United States, the vast majority of migrants would be unlikely to leave in the first place. Immigrating to the United States for economic reasons was their intention all along. And Mexico is just as likely to deny their asylum claim as the United States is. Hopefully, this will be the first item on the table when the negotiations with Mexico commence. If a safe third country agreement is not achieved, then crisis will likely continue. Does anyone actually think a ""safe third country"" agreement with Mexico requiring illegal alien invaders from Central America to apply for asylum in Mexico will actually compel these illegals to do so? Moreover, with the loopholes in the US immigration law concerning asylum, does anyone believe this will stem the tide of illegal alien invaders? Everyone should agree that sovereign nations enforce their own immigration laws. However, if that nation does not, another sovereign nation possesses no authority to ""force"" that nation to do so. Tariffs proposed by Trump through executive order violate the tenets of the Constitution and will do nothing to convince Mexico to enforce its own immigration law and/or keep Central American invaders from crossing into the united States. While it is true the incentives the united States offers to illegal alien invaders entices them to trek to our southern border, the loose asylum claims honored are just the tip of the iceberg. They come for the ""freebie"" handouts provided by US taxpayers. They come because of the promise of some type of amnesty and citizenship from both political parties. Last, but not least, these illegal alien invaders come for the ""preferred"" status afforded to them by all levels of government. It's a sad day in America when illegal alien invaders and their families can displace football with soccer in schools, marginalizing citizen children who seek athletic scholarships for college, as happened in the case of Dennis Michael Lynch's son. Closing these ""freebie"" incentives and nixing the ""preferred"" status afforded to illegal alien invaders would do wonders to cease the flow into the US. Those supporting Trump's measures of tariffs to ""force"" Mexico to enforce its immigration laws and compel the corrupt nation into entering a ""safe third country"" asylum agreement fail to address how this ""agreement"" would ""force"" illegal alien invaders to apply for asylum in Mexico first. Just like with the united States, these illegal alien invaders will find a way to cross the Mexican border undetected, traverse the nation to our southern border where they will cross undetected into the united States. In all seriousness, someone should explain to the American people how a ""safe third country"" agreement between Mexico and the US would cease illegal alien invasion across our borders. And one can hardly use Canada as an example since that border is essentially open for anyone and everyone to cross. Kobach noted how serious the issue has become for the US. The numbers illustrate just how dire the situation is. May was the third month in a row that border apprehensions exceeded 100,000. And it was the highest monthly total in over twelve years. More than half a million have been apprehended since October 1, 2018. To be sure, President Trump’s tariffs to compel Mexican cooperation are unprecedented. But so is the migrant crisis we are facing. It is unlike anything the United States has seen before. The President’s actions are exactly what is needed. Now we need him to hold firm until Mexico signs a safe third country agreement. Anything short of that would be insufficient to stem the flow of migrants. This number does not include how many crossed undetected to enter the united States, meaning that a number could be three times as high. This crisis has been ongoing since the illegitimate Hussein Soetoro administration. Illegal alien invasion, while always an issue on US borders, ramped up significantly due to the invitation extended to Central Americans by the former administration, Democrats, Republicans and advocates and promises of amnesty and citizenship. The invasion decreased early on in the Trump administration, but began increasing almost exponentially because of the floating of amnesty and citizenship by Trump for children brought into the US by their parents and through covert measures employed by Democrats, their sycophants, and illegal alien invasion advocates. Kobach describes Trump's tariff action as unprecedented but claims the action is warranted due to the illegal alien invasion crisis occurring at the US border. However, the president unilaterally, without congressional involvement, to assess a tariff against another country is unconstitutional and outside the power authorized to the president. The action might be warranted; but, it is up to Congress to legislate the tariff. One cannot and should not condone an unconstitutional action by a branch of government because of a ""crisis"" or is warranted. But, it is what citizens demand and accept when it is their team captain performing the action. Trump's actions are not what this republic needs to stem the tide of illegal alien invasion. What is needed, as mentioned in the previous article at Freedom Outpost, are measures authorized in the Constitution – calling up the citizen militia – to stem the tide of this invasion that has tremendous impact on citizens, ending the welfare/warfare state, applying the law equally to everyone, and ending ""preferred, protected"" status of the pet groups of the federal government. Condoning unconstitutional actions leads to tyranny and despotism. With the actions of Congress and presidents, including this one, that have stripped away most of the rights of the people and working to eradicate the rest, citizens should have learned the lesson by now.",2019-06-06

EN2707725,https://www.wrvo.org/post/lebanon-palestinians-protest-new-employment-restrictions,"The skies above Lebanon have been filled with colorful balloons in recent days. They're not in celebration, but in protest, and bear the message ""Enough, we want dignity"" scrawled in Arabic in black marker. In recent weeks, thousands of Palestinian refugees have been holding demonstrations in 12 refugee camps across Lebanon to protest a government crackdown on businesses hiring foreign workers without permits. The demonstrators oppose a new Lebanese labor ministry rule requiring them to have special work permits. Under Lebanese law, everyone who is considered a foreigner must acquire certain paperwork from the Ministry of Labor in order to work. Palestinians — who were forced out or fled in the war during Israel's creation in 1948, and were not allowed back — now make up about 10% of Lebanon's population. Some 450,000 Palestinians are registered in Lebanon with the U.N. refugee agency that works with Palestinian refugees. Various Lebanese governments have classified Palestinians either as foreigners, refugees or stateless people, even though many were born in Lebanon. Palestinians are generally not granted Lebanese citizenship. ""The laws are so gray ... every time a new labor minister comes to office, we become afraid because they change what it means to be 'Palestinian' here,"" says Rana Makki, a 27-year-old Palestinian activist and researcher. Palestinian refugees ""are highly marginalized, with two-thirds considered poor or extremely poor,"" with a high rate of unemployment exacerbated by the arrival of more than 1 million Syrian refugees to Lebanon, according to a 2016 U.N. Refugee Agency report. Saber Halimeh, a 26-year-old Palestinian journalist who writes for a website covering refugee issues, grew up in the Burj al-Barajneh refugee camp on the outskirts of Beirut. In this loud, bustling camp, which has narrow alleyways lined with dangerous electrical wires, he explains that what spurred these protests — which began last week — was the government closure of two Palestinian-owned businesses amid a larger government crackdown on Syrian refugees. In June, the Labor Ministry, led by Camille Abousleiman, announced a one-month deadline for companies to acquire work permits for anyone considered a foreigner in Lebanon. Once the deadline expired last week, the ministry began to close or fine businesses that didn't have permits from the government, nearly 600 of them Syrian-run or employing Syrians, and two Palestinian. ""It's clear that they're clamping down on Syrians because they want to send them home. But where would we go? We were born here and have no land to return to,"" Makki says. In 2010, labor laws in Lebanon were amended to exempt Palestinian refugees from paying for work permits. However, Palestinian businesses still had to register with the government and pay a quarter of the standard registration fee. In a series of tweets, Abousleiman denied that the government is targeting Palestinians and has tried to ease tensions by vowing to facilitate the granting of work permits for Palestinian refugees. ""Lebanese law protects Palestinian workers and guarantees that they receive minimum wage,"" he tweeted. But the Palestinian protesters are demanding much more than an overturn of the new work permit rule. Palestinians in Lebanon are barred from working in more than 20 professions, and their prospects in the labor market are limited to jobs in construction, administrative roles and small crafts. In the protests, ""We're not just asking for the simple right to work anymore, but also to work [in] professions we are banned from, such as medicine, law [and] engineering,"" Halimeh says. The protest movement is also asking the Lebanese government to clarify Palestinians' status, he says. ""Foreigners come here voluntarily for work or tourism,"" he says. ""We are refugees without a choice or a place to return to."" Halimeh says it is illegal to allow building materials in the camp where he lives, because the Lebanese government wants to discourage Palestinians from staying permanently. ""We cannot own houses outside the camps, ownership of land is difficult for Palestinians in Lebanon, and we also cannot build inside the camps. We are asking to be allowed to at least bring in building materials. Palestinians have been here for 70 years,"" he says. The Ain el-Helweh camp, located about an hour's drive south of Beirut, in the city of Saida, has become the symbolic center of the protests, activists tell NPR. ""Inside Ain el-Helweh, there's one of the largest vegetable markets in Saida, and since the protests began, they've put a stop to all Lebanese products entering or leaving the camps,"" Halimeh says. ""They're trying to prove a point that Palestinians aren't a burden on Lebanese society. We actually contribute to the economy in a positive way."" Palestinians have set up a committee to to negotiate with the Lebanese government on ensuring working rights and defining their status as ""permanent residents."" Until an agreement is reached, Palestinian activists tell NPR they will continue to protest daily. ""There is big fear for my future. I cannot buy an apartment if I want to settle down and get married. No one guarantees my rights in the workforce. I don't have insurance from the workplace,"" Halimeh says. ""It's a dark cloud that constantly hangs above us, creating great worry for what the future will hold."" ",2019-07-26

EN2503209,https://www.kspr.com/content/news/Statue-of-Liberty-climber-wont-serve-any-prison-time-507390131.html,"A woman who climbed the base of the Statue of Liberty last July 4 to protest the separation of families at the Mexican border came to her sentencing Tuesday with her face entirely covered with clear sticky tape, irritating a judge who refused to proceed until she removed it.

The Statue of Liberty, New York / Photo: Pexels / (MGN)

After she did so, U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein spared Therese Okoumou from prison for her conviction on multiple misdemeanor counts though he berated her for what he thought was a lack of concern for rescuers whose safety he said she jeopardized.

As she stood before him with a white headband across her forehead scrawled with the phrase ""I care!"" he ordered her to perform 200 hours of community service and five years of probation, leading her attorney, Ron Kuby, to suggest the judge might be seeing a lot of them in the future.

""I think there's hope"" otherwise, the judge responded, saying he would be willing to shorten the probation term at a later point if Okoumou did not commit more crimes.

Given a chance to speak in court, Okoumou called the case against her ""a fraud against injustice,"" an explanation for her continuing protest and the tape she had earlier painfully pulled off her face.

""I'm not a criminal,"" she told Gorenstein.

When Gorenstein took a break from the bench before announcing the sentence, Okoumou stood and turned around to face several dozen supporters before raising her fist in the air.

The gesture silenced the supporters, who raised their fists in return as everyone stood for a moment before Okoumou blew a kiss to them and turned around to await her sentence.

Outside court, she was surrounded by supporters as she railed the immigration policies of the Trump administration, saying they're what prompted the Statue of Liberty protest.

""We have people in cages? What was I supposed to do?"" she said. ""I made my point. ... Find your own conscience. Don't look up to me.""

The nearly four-hour demonstration forced an evacuation of 4,330 people from the statue grounds on one of its busiest days of the year.

As he announced his sentence, Gorenstein noted that Okoumou repeatedly ignored orders to descend from a perch at the feet of the statue that was high enough that a prosecutor said it could have seriously injured or killed her or tourists below. New York Police Department rescuers were forced to climb a rickety ladder and gird themselves like mountain climbers to safely bring her down.

The judge said she tried to push down the ladder, jeopardizing rescuers.

Prosecutors noted in presentencing papers that since Okoumou's arrest, she has twice climbed the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, forcing its evacuation, and has climbed onto the roof of an Austin, Texas, building, leading to another arrest in which charges are pending.

The Texas climb led to her being subjected to electronic monitoring in New York, though Gorenstein ordered the removal of the device Tuesday.

Kuby said Gorenstein was overestimating the danger to rescuers posed by his client's statue climb. The lawyer called them the most elite rescuers ""on the planet.""

The confirmed death toll in Zimbabwe, neighbouring Mozambique and Malawi surpassed 500, with hundreds more feared dead in towns and villages that were completely submerged. Aid agencies and several governments continued to step up their deployments, with helicopters in short supply for hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the cyclone. Spokesman Herve Verhoosel, of the World Food Programme (WFP), told reporters in Geneva of the “alarming news” that the Marowanyati dam in Zimbabwe was hit by heavy rains overnight, putting populations in the region at risk. Using WFP drones in the aftermath of #CycloneIdai to assess infrastructure damage in urban and remote areas helps provide first responders with a clearer picture of some of the challenges that lie ahead – when every minute counts. pic.twitter.com/ZuLNEQ77FM — World Food Programme (@WFP) March 21, 2019 Zimbabwe’s defence minister said more than 120 bodies had been washed into neighbouring Mozambique, where residents there buried them, and more bodies were still being recovered in rivers, raising the official death toll in the country to 259. “Most of the bodies were washed into Mozambique and because they were in a really bad state, they could not keep the bodies,” defence minister Oppah Muchinguri said, speaking in the eastern city of Mutare. “So they ended up burying them.” Meanwhile, the confirmed death toll in Mozambique rose to 217, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported, and in Malawi, at least 56 people were killed. But that was sure to rise. Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi has estimated that 1,000 people could have been killed in his country alone. Zimbabwean officials have said some 350 people may have died in their country. Homes, villages and entire towns were submerged across central Mozambique, where flooding created a muddy inland ocean 30 miles wide. The UN food aid agency said 400,000 people were displaced and “in urgent need of life-saving assistance” in Mozambique’s coastal city of Beira and flooded areas along the Pungue and Buzi rivers. A section of road damaged by Cyclone Idai in Nyamatanda, about 50km from Beira in Mozambique (Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP) The persistent rains lifted in some areas on Thursday, and floodwaters began to recede in Beira, the worst-hit city, and in the countryside, according to a Mozambican government report. “Yesterday, 910 people were rescued by the humanitarian community,” said Caroline Haga, of the International Federation of the Red Cross in Beira. She said 210 were rescued by five helicopters and 700 were saved by boats. Aid groups were continuing to work non-stop to rescue families desperately clinging to tree branches and rooftops for safety from the surging waters. “A family saw their brick house swept away from them. When they went to another house for safety, the roof collapsed,” Machiel Pouw, Save the Children’s response team leader in Mozambique, said in a statement. “Another family fled for safety in a tree. There are tens of thousands of heartbreaking stories like this, lives shattered over the past days.” It will be days before Mozambique’s inundated plains drain towards the Indian Ocean and even longer before the full scale of the devastation is known. The WFP said Malawi’s government had reported more than 920,000 people in the country were affected by the floods. The agency said Idai had had a “limited impact” on Malawi, and projected that the number of affected people will decline as they return home. In Zimbabwe, 90% of the district of Chimanimani – the country’s hardest-hit – was significantly damaged, the agency said, estimating that 200,000 people would need food assistance over the next three months. Aid has been slow to reach affected villagers due to collapsed infrastructure, although the military has been handing out small packets of cooking oil, maize meal and beans.",2019-03-21

EN2489579,https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1496117/xinjiang-silence-muslims,"China denies both the scale and the purpose of the repression

By Gwynne Dyer

Muslim governments were not silent when Burma murdered thousands of Rohingya, its Muslim minority, and expelled 700,000 of them across the border into Bangladesh. They were unanimous in their anger when the Trump administration moved the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But they are almost silent on China's attempt to suppress Islam in its far western province, Xinjiang.

It is the most brazen frontal assault on Muslims in modern history. Up to a million Chinese citizens have been sent to concentration camps in Xinjiang for the non-crime of being Muslim. They are also guilty of the non-crime of being a ten-million-strong ethnic minority, mostly Uighurs but including a million and a half Kazakhs, who do not feel sufficiently ‘Chinese', but Islam is the focus of the state's anger.

And in the face of this repression, the 49 Muslim-majority countries of the world have said almost nothing. Malaysia refused to send a dozen Uighur refugees back to China last year, four members of Kuwait's parliament made a public protest in January, and Turkey loudly condemned China's behaviour last month, but the other 46 governments have assiduously avoided the issue. It is very strange.

When Turkey finally did cut loose, foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said: ""It is no longer a secret that more than a million Uighur Turks exposed to arbitrary arrests are subjected to torture and political brainwashing"" in Chinese prisons....""The reintroduction of concentration camps in the 21st century and the systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities against the Uighur Turks is a great embarrassment for humanity.""

But even then, other Muslim countries remained silent. With the honourable exception of Al-Jazeera, the issue is rarely even mentioned in the Arab media, and popular awareness of what is happening is minimal in big Muslim countries like Iran, Pakistan and Indonesia. Why?

It is true that the mass repression of the Uighurs and other Muslims in China only became known abroad in the past year, although it was already state policy at least two years ago.

It is true, too, that a lot of the evidence is circumstantial. While there are plenty of first-person reports of the brutal treatment of the Uighurs, for example, the estimates of how many are actually imprisoned - ""up to a million"", which would be one-tenth of all the Muslims in Xinjiang - are really estimates of how many the camps could hold, based on satellite observations of their size.

China denies both the scale and the purpose of the repression. These camps, it says, are ‘vocational training centres' that tackle ‘extremism' through ‘thought transformation' (what used to be called ‘brainwashing', an old political tradition in Communist China).

The detainees are held indefinitely - there are no formal charges or sentences, but hardly anybody has been released in the past couple of years - and are allegedly volunteers. They are ‘trainees', said the top Chinese official in Xinjiang, Shohrat Zakir, last October, who are grateful for the opportunity to ""reflect on their mistakes.""

Shohrat Zakir is obviously a Muslim name: as always, there are collaborators and careerists among the oppressed. But it is a classic late colonial situation, with a Communist twist.

The population of Xinjiang was over 90% Muslim and Turkic-speaking when the new Communist regime in China reconquered the region in 1949. Beijing's original solution, as in Tibet to the south, was to drown the native population in Han Chinese immigrants: Muslims are now only 45% of the population.

When the inevitable push-back came - anti-Chinese race riots and some terrorist attacks - the Chinese regime responded with intense surveillance and repression of the native population. Part of the package was an attempt to curb Islamic observance and the use of the local Turkic language. And when that wasn't producing the desired result, Beijing began expanding the ‘re-education centres' that now hold up to a tenth of the Muslim population.

There is nothing surprising in all this. Assimilation to the Han Chinese norm was the policy of all Chinese governments even before the Communist takeover. What is surprising is the response - or rather, the lack of response - of Muslim governments elsewhere.

Why are they silent? Mainly because China is lavishing loans and grants on them: $20 billion in loans to Arab countries, a rumoured $6 billion to Pakistan, even more to the nearby Muslim countries of Central Asia ($27 billion in joint industrial projects in Kazakhstan alone). They need the money, so they shut up. So do their tame media.

When the de facto dictator of Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, visited China recently, he endorsed China's right to take ""anti-terrorism"" and ""de-extremism"" measures in Xinjiang. Of course, he needs China's support in fighting off the accusations that he ordered the murder of Jamal Khashoggi even more than he needs the money.

Xinjiang's Muslims have been abandoned by the ‘umma', the world community of Muslims. They are on their own and they are suffering.

U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in California issued the preliminary injunction blocking the new asylum restrictions Wednesday afternoon, just hours after a hearing where he grilled a government attorney over the new sweeping change to asylum policy. The article goes on to state the following: The policy, announced by the Trump administration last week, would broadly end asylum eligibility for migrants who pass through another country on their journey to the United States’ southern border with Mexico but do not attempt to seek the protection in those other countries first. Tigar wondered if countries like Mexico and Guatemala had the ability to process asylum-seekers, saying that in Mexico “applications are up dramatically” but there was no way to know if Mexico could handle the volume of asylum-seekers that might make claims.

EN2564599,https://wfin.com/abc-world-news/actor-ben-stiller-speaks-out-on-syria-as-us-warns-of-intensifying-violence/,"Paul Morigi/Getty Images(WASHINGTON) — In over eight years of war, the headlines of suffering and violence in Syria have, at times, faded. Actor Ben Stiller tried to change that on Wednesday. The goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees testified in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the humanitarian impact of the war and what the U.S. should be doing about it. It couldn’t come at a more critical time. There are rising concerns of intense fighting in the country’s northwest province Idlib — the last rebel stronghold that’s in the crosshairs of strongman Bashar al Assad and his backers Russia and Iran, but also a hub of terror groups like al-Qaeda’s affiliate. For those areas liberated from the Islamic State, there are major questions about what comes next as the Trump administration plans to draw down its troop levels and has pulled funding and called for other countries to pay for stabilization projects critical to restoring services and keeping terror groups at bay. During his testimony, Stiller turned quickly to how watching the refugee crisis galvanized him to act: “I didn’t want to just keep watching. I wanted to do something.” “Eight years into this crisis, we must not look away,” he said, praising the work of the U.N. refugee agency, but said it is lacking the resources needed to address the crisis. “Given severe underfunding, there is nothing easy about making daily difficult choices, like which programs to downsize or which families won’t receive thermal blankets during a cold, harsh winter,” he added. Since the conflict began, the U.S. has provided around $9 billion for humanitarian aid, according to the State Department. But the Trump administration has pulled back — asking others to pay more, moving to withdraw U.S. troops, and refusing to provide funding to rebuild areas under Assad’s control. In March, the U.N. and European Union hosted a donor conference, securing pledges of up to $7 billion for humanitarian aid for Syria. Of that, $397 million came from the U.S., with State Department Special Envoy Jim Jeffrey announcing the majority will go to countries in the region that host hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees each. The deeper U.S. cuts have been to stabilization funding — the projects like rubble removal, de-mining, and restoration of services like running water that the U.S. has said are necessary to restore life to areas freed of ISIS and prevent the rise of a new terror group. Last August, the U.S. cut over $200 million in stabilization, and in this year’s budget proposal, the White House wanted to zero out any more funding. The U.S. is instead “looking for new sources of stability funds,” according to Amb. Jeffrey, after securing $325 million from coalition partners last summer, most of that from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But the needs on the ground are great, and it’s unclear where new stabilization funding may come from. What the U.S. has made clear with allies in Europe and the Middle East is that none of them will provide funding for areas controlled by the Assad regime or its supporters. They’re trying to use that as leverage over Russia and Assad to come back to U.N. talks about the country’s future, knowing that both parties are desperate not to foot the enormous bill to rebuild. So far, however, it hasn’t worked — with Russia, Iran, and Turkey engaging in their own talks. But that peace process is fragile. Turkey backs the rebel groups in Idlib, even those with ties to al Qaeda and other jihadists, and Assad, Russia, and Iran want to take back these last strongholds of opposition — with airstrikes and bombings flaring up in recent weeks. The State Department said yesterday the U.S. is “alarmed by the escalation of violence,” which continues “to destabilize the region, exacerbate the dire humanitarian situation, and cause dozens of civilian deaths and injuries — many of them children.” “The violence must end,” said spokesperson Morgan Ortagus, accusing Russia and the regime of “blatantly” targeting humanitarian groups like the White Helmets, the volunteer EMS responders who have gained international acclaim for their efforts to rescue Syrians from bombings and airstrikes but have also been allegedly attacked by a smear disinformation campaign by Russia. The head of the White Helmets was in Washington over the last week, meeting with lawmakers and officials at the White House, State Department, and U.S. Agency for International Development and asking for more support. Despite the larger cuts to Syria, the White Helmets received an additional $5 million in U.S. funding in March. Raed Saleh told ABC News the appointment of Ambassador Jeffrey last year has given the group confidence and they see the U.S. more engaged now, but when asked about Trump’s desire to withdraw the U.S. from Syria, militarily and financially, he said they’ll “continue to monitor the other developments.” Copyright © 2019, ABC Radio.

OSLO: Rescue helicopters were evacuating people from a cruise ship which suffered engine failure on Saturday (Mar 23) in stormy weather off the west coast of Norway, police and rescue workers said. The maritime rescue service said the Viking Sky, with about 1,300 passengers and crew on board, had sent out a mayday signal as it had been drifting towards land. Advertisement The crew were later able to restart one engine and the ship was at anchor about 2km from land. Eight people suffered light injuries and had been evacuated, said the rescue service, which was coordinating the response. It did not give details of how the people were hurt. Passengers were hoisted one-by-one from the deck of the vessel and airlifted to a village just north of the town of Molde on Norway's west coast. Only 87 people had been evacuated by 1750 GMT, and the airlift was set to continue throughout the night, rescue service spokeswoman Borghild Eldøen told Reuters. Advertisement Advertisement Two purpose-built vessels operated by the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue had been forced to turn back due to the severe weather, the service said. Waves were 6-8 metres high, with wind blowing at 24 metres per second, according to the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. The storm was expected to last at least until midnight local time (2300 GMT). The stretch of water known as Hustadvika is known for its fierce weather and shallow waters are dotted with reefs. The Norwegian government is evaluating whether to build a giant ocean tunnel through a nearby mountain to improve safety. The Viking Sky, built in 2017, belongs to Viking Ocean Cruises, part of the Viking Cruises group founded by Norwegian billionaire Torstein Hagen. According to the company's website, its passenger capacity is 930. Several vessels and four helicopters took part in the rescue and facilities to receive passengers have been set up on land, the rescue service said. All search and rescue teams in the region are mobilising, including 60 volunteers from the Norwegian Red Cross, a spokesman said. Viking's operational headquarters, located in Basel, Switzerland, did not respond when contacted by telephone. ",2019-03-23

EN2591170,https://reliefweb.int/report/greece/eight-years-side-unaccompanied-minor-refugees,"Since 2011, METAdrasi has safely escorted 11,000 unaccompanied children to appropriate accommodation facilities

For decades, unaccompanied minor refugees who arrived in Greece remained for a long time in detention facilities, under precarious and inappropriate conditions, exposed in dangers and exploitation networks. METAdrasi, since its founding in 2011, and following the “no child in detention” principle, sought to resolve this long-standing problem, by initiating the activity “Escorting Missions for Unaccompanied Children”. Within three months, the news of the creation of an entity responsible for escorting children had spread across Greece. METAdrasi was overwhelmed by escorting requests, mainly from police stations looking for ways to transport children refugees who were in their holding cells towards appropriate accommodation facilities. Thus, METAdrasi’s trained network of escorts was created, which consists of social scientists and interpreters, is active throughout Greece and operating ad hoc every time a need for escorting comes up.

The difficulties in the implementation of the activity have been numerous. In the first years, escorting teams repeatedly faced emergency incidents, when smugglers followed them and tried to detach the children from the team. In the period 2014-2015, the serious lack of resources, with the simultaneous skyrocketing number of children arriving in Greece, lead METAdrasi to appeal to the private sector. Aegean Airlines, Hellenic Seaways and Blue Star Ferries responded immediately; they supported and continue supporting the activity by offering tickets for the transport of children. Additionally, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), recognising the emergency of the situation and the need to reinforce the activity, started since 2016 supporting in a stable basis the escorting missions for unaccompanied minors, with funding by the European Commission.

The stories from the escorting missions are plenty and each one is unique: 14-year-old Azal from Afghanistan lost her family in the Aegean Sea, making it impossible for her to face the sea. She was escorted from Lesbos island towards an appropriate accommodation facility in Athens by airplane, thanks to the courtesy of Aegean Airlines. METAdrasi’s escorting team stood by her side, until Azal felt safe, as from the very start of the flight, the girl wouldn’t stop crying, while she wouldn’t dare to turn her look towards the airplane’s window.

“Each mission is a life changing experience. Seeing the anguish of these children and the conditions from which we take them, I feel I am contributing to their lives’ improvement” mentions Christina, METAdrasi’s escort.

In another mission, ten children travelled by boat from Chios to Piraeus. “When we went to pick up the children, they had their eyes lowered by fear. It was not until we entered the boat that they started smiling, as they felt sure that they were finally leaving behind the island and the conditions they had to go through”, recounts Anna, member of the escorting team. “When an escort meets a child about to be escorted, he appears in his eyes as a savior. In fact, many times, children feel such a relief, that they confide in their escort their highly traumatic experiences, for the first, and maybe the last time in their lives. We always give priority to the children under the hardest conditions”, adds METAdrasi’s president Lora Pappa.

Within eight years of “Escorting Missions for Unaccompanied Minors” 11,000 children have been escorted in total, during 4,000 escorting missions. According to the latest data, 40% of the missions concern escorting from the islands to the mainland. 41% of the escorted children come from detention centers, 36% from hotspots in the islands and 8% from homelessness. Observing, through this activity, the imperative needs of this vulnerable group, METAdrasi was led to the creation of a protective network for the unaccompanied children, which consists of innovative activities: Escorting Missions, Guardianship Network, Foster Care, Transit Accommodation Facilities, Supported Independent Living for unaccompanied minors aged 16-18. Currently, more than 3,700 unaccompanied refugee children are found in our country, and although a solution to the issue of their escorting has been found, 6 out of 10 children still live under precarious and inappropriate, for their age, conditions, due to the lack of proper accommodation facilities.",2019-05-17

In a video (below) from Memphis Animal Services, Bobo bounds into Rogers' arms, his tail wagging furiously. He can hardly contain his excitement when he's reunited with his owner, skittering around him with heaping licks of love. A missing friend Rogers woke up early in the morning Aug. 31 to find Bobo had disappeared. Friends made posters with the 1-year-old pitbull-labrador mix's sweet face to find him, the shelter wrote on Facebook. Two weeks later, the affable pup ended up at Memphis Animal Services. An employee recognized him and called Rogers' friend, who drove him to the shelter to reunite them. Cue the happy tears The shelter sent Bobo back with a year's supply of heartworm prevention medication, a bag of dog food, a harness, leash, collar and ID tag, so if he ever wanders off again, he can safely return to his owner, the shelter said. A local animal hospital will accept donations for Bobo's future care. Anthony Rogers told CNN affiliate WMC he rescued Bobo as a puppy.

Snow began falling north of Seattle with some areas recording 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow before it made its way south and enveloped the city. Many businesses closed early so workers could get home. Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, saying everyone in the state should focus on staying safe. ""Forecasters predict this may be a storm unlike one we've seen in many years,"" he said. In California, more than 120 visitors and staff members were rescued after being snowbound in a Sierra Nevada resort for five days. Up to 7 feet (2 meters) of snow had trapped the guests and staff beginning Sunday at Montecito Sequoia Lodge in Kings Canyon National Park, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Alicia Embrey said. Crews had to travel by snowmobile to get to the lodge in mountains east of Fresno. Heavy equipment and crews then cleared more than 20 fallen trees and 8 miles (13 kilometers) of deep snow on the road leading to the lodge to allow guests and staff to leave the property Thursday night. Another winter storm was on the way to the region. In Yosemite National Park, as many as 50 housing structures near Half Dome Village were damaged by trees toppled during a snowstorm earlier this week, displacing more than 160 employees who provide food, lodging and other services for visitors. Elsewhere, more than 148,000 customers were without electricity in Michigan following days of freezing rain. The Consumers Energy utility said power would be restored by late Sunday. In Seattle, officials urged people to stay off the roads as traffic slowed to a standstill in some places because of the snow. ""Doesn't matter where you're going, expect it to take a very. long. time,"" the Washington Department of Transportation said on Twitter. Schools and colleges had canceled classes ahead of the storm expected to bring 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) of snow. Scores of flights were cancelled or delayed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Snowfall from Sunday and Monday lingered into the week as below-freezing temperatures gripped the area. A 59-year-old man died Thursday from exposure at a Seattle light rail station. Additional shelter space opened by city and county officials was filling up. The city was focused on people who are willing to come inside, Will Lemke, spokesman for the Seattle Human Services Department, told the Seattle Times. ""This is an extreme weather event, and offering shelter is the most important thing we can do right now,"" he said. Forecasters said Portland, Oregon, could get up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of snow later in the day, with two more snowstorms expected to hit the city next week. Residents in Portland and Seattle, two cities where rain is more common than snow in the winter, emptied grocery store shelves and waited in long lines to buy shovels and de-icer. Autumn Sang was at a mobbed grocery store in Tualatin, Oregon, on Friday stocking up for the coming storm for herself and her neighbor, who is disabled and doesn't have a car. Sang said she had never seen the store so crowded. She grew up in southern Oregon, where snow is more common, and wasn't fazed by the forecast. ""I love it. I'm excited about it,"" she said of the snow. ""I think that Portlanders, most of them are city people and they come from a lot of different places, so they're not so used to it. It's like, 'Use your brain! If you don't have to go out, don't go out.'"" ___ AP journalists Amanda Lee Myers in Los Angeles and Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report.

In August, WFP assisted 416,814 people in need with 3,763 metric tons of food.

WFP distributed US$ 611,781 in cash transfers to cover families’ food needs.

US$ 15 million is the net funding shortfall for the next six months (September 2019 – February 2020).

Operational Updates

• In August, WFP reached 416,814 girls, boys, women and men across 29 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, distributed 3,763 mt of food through its partners and transferred US$ 611,781 to food insecure families.

• This included 33,012 people displaced by conflict, 4,970 returnees from Iran and Pakistan and 3,948 people affected by flooding. A total of 37,534 drought-affected people in Herat and Kandahar provinces received assistance in August as previous distributions in those areas had been delayed due to conflict and insecurity.

• WFP dispatched food to provide seasonal support to 27,902 highly vulnerable people in Parwan and Wardak provinces that were not part of the 22 provinces selected for the full-scale drought response from October 2018 to June 2019. While needs and food insecurity are high in these provinces, the communities were less affected by the drought and are being served now.

• In provinces with high rates of moderate acute malnutrition, WFP supplied health centers with 489 mt of specialized nutritious foods for 97,495 children aged 6-59 months and 47,657 pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. Some 1,000 children received specialized nutritious foods as part of general food distributions to prevent the deterioration of their nutritional status.

• Under WFP’s school-feeding programme, 77,974 primary school students received high energy biscuits each day at school. Among them, 49,623 girls also received vegetable oil to take home for themselves and their families to encourage school attendance and reduce gender disparity.

• The United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) transported 2,079 passengers from 105 different agencies and organizations to 19 locations.

Since January, UNHAS has transported 16,949 passengers, an 18 percent increase compared to the same period in 2018.",2019-10-02

EN2413410,https://www.batonrougepost.com/news/258982591/deadly-coal-mine-accident-in-china-shaanxi-province-kills-21-miners,"BEIJING, China - In what is being dubbed as the deadliest mining accident in China this year, 21 miners were killed after the roof of a coal mine collapsed in the country's Shaanxi province. A report in the state-run Peoples Daily on Sunday revealed that the incident took place at the Lijiagou mine in the city of Shenmu in northwest China at around 4.30 pm (0830 GMT) on Saturday. The report claimed that the roof of the mine, which is owned by Baiji Mining Co Ltd, collapsed when 87 people were underground. Authorities quoted in the report confirmed that 66 miners were rescued from the mine, while 21 were trapped underground. Initially, local reports claimed that 19 of the 21 trapped miners were found dead after the roof caved in. However, emergency operations to rescue two missing miners continued for hours after the accident at the end of which, their bodies were found. According to a report in the official news agency Xinhua, city government officials confirmed on Sunday that 66 miners were safely evacuated. The report also stated that the cause of the accident at the site is under investigation. It noted that authorities in Shanxi province would carry out inspections at high-risk coal mines in the region after Saturday's accident became the deadliest reported so far this year in Chinas coal industry. Poor safety record in focus Deadly mining accidents in China have become common in recent years, despite the government's efforts to improve safety. The frequent accidents and increasing mining casualties in the country has earned China's mining industry the status of being one the deadliest in the world. Saturday's accident comes merely weeks after seven workers were killed and three others were injured in an underground transport accident at the Fengchun coal mine under the Chongqing Energy Group in Chinas southwestern city of Chongqing. The accident, which occurred on December 17, 2018, took place when the connecting segment of a mining skip broke, which led it to slide down the inclined shaft. Before that, an accident at a coal mine in Yuncheng county of Shangdong province left eight miners dead in October last year. Authorities said at the time that pressure inside the Yuncheng coal mine caused rocks to rip apart and break, killing workers inside. Security checks at 41 coal mines in the Shandong province were ordered soon after the accident. In June 2018, 11 workers were killed and nine others were injured in a powerful explosion at an iron mine in China's northeast Liaoning province. Before that, in May of last year, a methane gas explosion inside a coal mine in the country's central Hunan province killed at least five workers. According to authorities in China, which is the worlds largest producer of coal, the number of deaths from mining accidents have reduced in recent years, but the number of accidents have continued to rise. Last year, in a bid to improve safety conditions, Chinas coal mine safety watchdog launched inspections of mines across the country. The inspections are expected to continue until June this year. Earlier this week, the state-backed Shanghai Securities News (SSN) reported that some mining firms in major coal hubs in Shandong and Henan provinces, along with some in parts of northeastern China have received notices from the National Coal Mine Safety Administration. The notices reportedly ordered the mines to halt operations for inspections.",2019-01-14

BEATRICE MATEGWA

Twenty-five years ago, in 1994, Celine Kalingirwa was just being born in Rwanda, fondly known as the land of a thousand hills.

She was just three months old when a bloody conflict consumed her country, leaving about 800,000 people dead in 100 days. Hundreds of thousands of refugees were also fleeing to neighbouring countries.

Chances of her survival were almost nil, but she is alive today, and proudly wears her country’s flag and a blue helmet – working as a medical doctor and peacekeeper in South Sudan, now still emerging from a protracted conflict.

“As I grow up, I get to understand what happened,” says Dr Kalingirwa. “It’s a really sad history to have – having some parts of the family not being able to know them or see them – just seeing them in pictures, is sad,” she says.

“As we go forward our hearts are strong … I would really like to appreciate and thank my parents for whatever they did to protect me and my siblings,” she says, as she stares into space as if imagining what could have otherwise befallen her family.

EN2630316,https://www.humboldtjournal.ca/hong-kong-police-fire-tear-gas-water-as-protest-escalates-1.23852750,"HONG KONG — Following a day of sit-ins, tear gas and clashes with police, Hong Kong students and civil rights activists vowed Wednesday to keep protesting a proposed extradition bill that has become a lightning rod for concerns over greater Chinese control and erosion of civil liberties in the former British colony. The violence marked a major escalation of the biggest political crisis in years for the semi-autonomous Chinese territory and forced the delay of legislative debate on the contentious bill. article continues below College student Louis Wong said he considered the blockade of government headquarters and the Legislative Council a success because it appeared to prevent Beijing loyalists from advancing amendments to a pair of laws that would make it easier to send suspected criminals to China. ""This is a public space and the police have no right to block us from staying here,"" Wong said, surveying a garbage-strewn intersection in the Admiralty neighbourhood that had been blocked off by security forces after protesters broke through a police cordon and entered the government complex. ""We'll stay until the government drops this law and (Chinese President) Xi Jinping gives up on trying to turn Hong Kong into just another city in China like Beijing and Shanghai,"" he said. Protesters who had massed outside the government building overnight Tuesday began pressing against the police early Wednesday, leading to police firing tear gast and pepper spray. The overwhelmingly young crowd overflowed onto a major downtown road as they overturned barriers and tussled with police. When some appeared to have breached a cordon around the building, the police launched their response. A weekend protest of the extradition measure drew hundreds of thousands of people, and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said in a statement early Thursday that the peaceful rally had become a ""blatant, organized riot."" At a brief news conference held as the chaos swirled outside on Wednesday afternoon, Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung said the ""serious clashes"" forced police to use pepper spray, bean bag rounds, rubber bullets, and tear gas. Officers also were hurt, some seriously, by rocks, bottles, traffic cones, metal barricades and other items thrown by protesters. Police spokesman Gong Weng Chun defended the use of tear gas and other nonlethal weapons, saying officers wouldn't have had to do so if they weren't facing a threat that could lead to serious injury or death. As of 10 p.m. Wednesday, at least 72 people were brought to seven hospitals, with two in serious condition, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority said. Of those, 41 were later released, it added. Lo also called the demonstration a riot, which could mean long jail terms for anyone arrested, adding to fears that Hong Kong's government is using public disturbance laws to intimidate protesters. ""We condemn such irresponsible behaviour,"" Lo said. ""There's no need to hurt innocent people to express your opinions,"" he said, adding that people should not ""do anything they will regret for the rest of their lives."" A curt government statement said a scheduled 11 a.m. legislative session would be ""changed to a later time."" Officials gave no indication of when that would be, and Lam cancelled a news briefing. Some businesses also closed for the day, and labour strikes and class boycotts were called. The protests by the bill's opponents are the largest since pro-democracy demonstrations closed down parts of the Asian financial centre for more than three months in 2014. The demonstrations pose a challenge to Xi, who has said he would not tolerate Hong Kong being used as a base to question the ruling Communist Party's authority. But they are also giving a voice to the young in the territory who feel alienated by a political process dominated by the economic elite. The legislative process for the bill remained unclear following the violence, which largely ended by about 5 p.m. after police herded demonstrators across a pedestrian bridge. Traffic in one of the busiest parts of the city remained blocked, however, and several hundred protesters seemed in no hurry to leave. The protesters said they hoped the blockade would lead to the measure being shelved. ""We want the government to just set the legislation aside and not bring it back,"" said a protester who gave only his first name, Marco, because he feared possible repercussions from authorities. Another protester, who gave her name only as King, also fearing repercussions, said the protest was a watershed moment for Hong Kong's youth. ""We have to stand up for our rights or they will be taken away,"" she said. Dressed in black T-shirts and jeans, many protesters appeared undaunted by police demands to disperse. The demonstrators also appeared mindful of Beijing's growing use of electronic surveillance such as facial recognition technology to build dossiers on those it considers politically unreliable, and many of them wore surgical masks to hide their features as well as reduce the effects of tear gas. Such protests are never tolerated in mainland China, and Hong Kong residents can face travel bans and other repercussions if they cross the border. In an interview with Hong Kong broadcaster TVB, Lam denied she was ""selling out"" Hong Kong with the extradition bill but conceded the measure would continue to attract criticism. ""It's time to let lawmakers with different opinions express their views under the legislative process,"" she said. ""On whether to retract or push it through ... our consideration is this: There is no doubt this issue is controversial. Explanation and dialogue are useful but perhaps that has not entirely dispelled worries."" Speaking of her commitment to her job, her voice broke as she said: ""They said I'm selling out Hong Kong. How could I do that? I grew up here with everyone else in the city."" Lam added that she has never ""felt guilty"" over the issue and believed she was doing the right thing. She said she felt ""worried and sad"" about the young protesters, but said that as a parent of two sons, she believed it would be wrong to cave in to ""wilfulbehaviour."" Under its ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong was supposed to be guaranteed the right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years following its handover from British rule in 1997. However, China's Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular laws. A vote on the legislation is scheduled on June 20. China's Foreign Ministry repeated its support for the bil, with spokesman Geng Shuang denying Beijing has been interfering in the city's affairs in a way that violates agreements made when Hong Kong was handed back to China. ""Hong Kong people's rights and freedoms have been fully guaranteed in accordance with law,"" he said. At the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump called it as ""big a demonstration as I've ever seen,"" adding: ""I hope it all works out for China and for Hong Kong."" In a statement, Australia's Foreign Ministry called for both sides to show restraint and said it had raised concerns about the proposed amendments at senior levels within the Hong Kong government. The protests are widely seen as reflecting growing apprehension about relations with the mainland, where Xi has said he has zero tolerance for those demanding greater self-rule for Hong Kong. Critics believe the extradition legislation would put Hong Kong residents at risk of becoming trapped in China's judicial system, in which opponents of Communist Party rule have been charged with economic crimes or ill-defined national security offences, and would not be guaranteed free trials. Lam said the government has considered concerns from the private sector and altered the bill to improve human rights safeguards. She said without the changes, Hong Kong risked becoming a haven for fugitives. She emphasized that extradition cases would be decided by Hong Kong courts. Opponents say the changes would significantly compromise Hong Kong's legal independence, long viewed as one of the crucial differences between the territory and the mainland. Hong Kong now limits extradition to jurisdictions with which it has existing agreements and to others on an individual basis. China has been excluded from those agreements because of concerns over its judicial independence and human rights record. ___ Associated Press writers Raf Wober and Alice Fung in Hong Kong, Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, Kevin Freking in Washington and Sally Ho in Seattle contributed.",2019-06-12

Tim LaBarge 2019 Ford and Agility Robotics explore how a new robot, Digit, can help get packages to your door efficiently with the help of self-driving vehicles. (CNN) - Robots are getting better at doing human jobs. That's probably good for the economy — but there are some serious downsides, too. Machines are expected to displace about 20 million manufacturing jobs across the world over the next decade, according to a report released Wednesday by Oxford Economics, a global forecasting and quantitative analysis firm. That means about 8.5% of the global manufacturing workforce could be displaced by robots. The report also notes that the move to robots tends to generate new jobs as fast as it automates them, however it could contribute to income inequality. The use of robots is on the rise: At this point, every new robot that is installed displaces 1.6 manufacturing workers on average, according to the Oxford Economics model. Automation isn't a new trend in manufacturing, of course. The automotive industry, for example, used 43% of the robots in the world in 2016. But robots are becoming cheaper than many human workers, in part because of the falling costs of machines. The average unit price per robot has dropped 11% between 2011 and 2016, according to Oxford Economics. And they are increasingly capable of functioning in more sophisticated processes and varied contexts. On top of that, the demand for manufactured goods is rising. China presents a big opportunity for growth in automation. That country already accounts for a fifth of the world's industrial robots, with every third new one being installed there. Beijing ""is investing in robots to position itself as the global manufacturing leader,"" Oxford Economics said. By 2030, some 14 million robots could be working in China, ""dwarfing"" the rest of the world, according to Oxford. The effect on economic output could be tremendous. Oxford Economics estimates that boosting robot installations to 30% above the current growth forecast by 2030 would lead that year to a 5.3% increase in global GDP, or $4.9 trillion. That's more than the projected size of Germany's GDP for that year. So what's not to love? Robots will boost productivity and economic growth, as well as spur industries that don't even exist yet. But Oxford Economics also warns that they will be seriously disruptive. How automation could lead to inequality One potential downside to the robot revolution: Automation could increase income inequality. ""This great displacement will not be evenly distributed around the world, or within countries,"" according to the report. ""Our research shows that the negative effects of robotization are disproportionately felt in the lower-income regions compared with higher-income regions of the same country."" The workers who drive knowledge and innovation within the manufacturing industry tend to be concentrated in larger cities, and those skills are harder to automate. That's why urban areas will deal better with the increased automation, according to the report. On the whole, the increased use of automation will likely create new jobs at a pace comparable to the jobs that will be lost, which nullifies fears about permanent job destruction, according to the Oxford study. That said, the poorer regions that are expected to lose the most jobs will probably not benefit equally from this new job creation due to a gap in skills. That will lead to increased income inequality between cities and rural areas, as well as between regions. ""Automation will continue to drive regional polarization in many of the world's advanced economies, unevenly distributing the benefits and costs across the population,"" the report said. For policy makers, this means they will have to think about how the increased efficiency will hold up against the effect on income inequality. Some have already worked automation into their political platforms. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, recently said he was worried about what artificial intelligence and robotics ""will mean to working people in this country,"" for example. ""We need to have a long discussion to make certain that millions of workers are not thrown out on the street because of robotics,"" he said during a CNN town hall in February. In the United States, Oregon, Louisiana, Texas, Indiana and North Carolina are the most vulnerable states, according to Oxford Economics. That's because those states are reliant on manufacturing jobs that could disappear because of robots. In Oregon, for example, ""high dependence on manufacturing ... and the state's exposure to globally competitive sectors, means its workers are vulnerable to rapid technological progress,"" according to the Oxford study. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Hawaii, DC, Nevada, Florida and Vermont will see the least impact from increased robotization. Manufacturing plays a smaller role in those places.",2019-06-26
