EN2496868,https://katc.com/ap-national-news/2019/03/17/the-latest-more-evacuations-in-deadly-midwestern-flooding/,,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — The Latest on flooding in the Midwest (all times local): 4 p.m. Flooding in Nebraska has badly damaged up to 500 houses in one county alone. Greg London of the Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office said Sunday that one levee broke Thursday along the Platte River, and another broke Saturday. He estimates that up to 400 houses and cabins in the area known as Hanson’s Lake are damaged, including many that are completely submerged. Another 100 or so homes are damaged elsewhere in the county. The area is near where the Platte and Missouri rivers converge. A Missouri River levee nearby also breached on Thursday. London says many of the damaged homes are likely ruined. He says that while the area has had flooding before, this year’s disaster is “unprecedented.” ___ This update has been corrected to show the name of the county in Nebraska is Sarpy, not Sharpy. ___ 3:15 p.m. Flooding has reached record levels at 17 locations across Nebraska. The state’s emergency management agency says more record crests are expected in various rivers by Tuesday. Nebraska has had much of the worst of the late-winter flooding that’s been seen across the Midwest. Hundreds of homes are damaged and the state says 660 people are staying in shelters. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency says the Missouri River is expected to crest Sunday at 41 feet (12.5 meters) in Plattsmouth — 4 feet (1.22 meters) above the record set in 2011. Serious flooding there is expected to continue through next weekend. Crest records also were set along the Platte and Elkhorn rivers. The Elkhorn reached 24.6 feet (7.5 meters) Saturday in Waterloo, breaking the 1962 record by 5 1/2 feet (1.68 meters). Nearly 300 people have been rescued from high water across the state. At least one person has died in floodwaters in the state. A second death from flooding was reported in Iowa. ___ 3 p.m. Officials say residents of Green Bay, Wisconsin, who evacuated their homes due to flooding can return. Heavy rainfall and melting snow have led to dangerously high water in creeks and rivers across several Midwestern states. Even as the water receded in Green Bay, other parts of the Midwest are still under water or are bracing for flooding. In far southwestern Iowa, residents were being evacuated Sunday as floodwaters overtopped levees. And in St. Joseph, Missouri, volunteers are filling sandbags to help secure a levee protecting an industrial area. Green Bay Metro Fire Department lifted its emergency evacuation order at 10 a.m. Sunday for an eight- to 10-block area around the East River. The Green Bay Press Gazette reports city inspectors were out placing placards on front doors identifying those not currently inhabitable because they have no heat and those that are safe to re-enter. ___ 1:55 p.m. Flooding along the Missouri River is causing long delays for Amtrak passengers. The passenger rail service said Sunday that its Missouri River Runner service between St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, will have delays up to five hours because of flooding and rail congestion. Amtrak says all Missouri River Runner trains will be canceled Monday. The service typically travels twice daily between Missouri’s two metropolitan areas. ___ 12:40 p.m. The flooding Missouri River has damaged dozens of buildings at an Air Force base in Nebraska. The Omaha World-Herald reports that about one-third of the Offutt Air Force Base is under water. A spokeswoman for the base says 60 buildings, mostly on the south end of the base, have been damaged, including about 30 completely inundated with as much as 8 feet (2.4 meters) of water. Among the buildings badly damaged are the headquarters building and a hangar. Offutt’s lone runway is expected to remain closed until Tuesday afternoon. Airmen had been filling thousands of sandbags, but the newspaper reports that the sandbagging effort has been halted. ___ 11:40 a.m. Residents in parts of southwestern Iowa are being urged to leave their homes as a torrent of Missouri River water flows over and through levees. Heavy rainfall and snowmelt forced river levels across four Midwestern states to dangerous levels. Two deaths were blamed on the high and forceful water, and two other men have been missing for days. While river levels on Sunday were starting to level off in Nebraska, residents in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri were bracing for the worst still yet to come. Flooding has also been reported in Illinois, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The Missouri River reached a record 30.2 feet (9.2 meters) Sunday in Fremont County, Iowa, in the state’s far southwestern corner. People in parts of Bartlett and Thurman were being evacuated as water broke through or overtopped levees. County Emergency Management Director Mike Crecelius says it isn’t just the amount of water, it’s the swiftness of the current that creates a danger. ___ 11:20 a.m. Flooding caused by heavy rain and snowmelt is blamed for two deaths in the Midwest, and two others are missing. Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes in Nebraska and Iowa as levees succumbed to the rush of water. Flooding has also been reported in Illinois, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Authorities say 52-year-old Aleido Rojas Galan of Norfolk, Nebraska, died Friday night in southwestern Iowa. Officials say Galan and two others were in a vehicle that drove around a barricade and was swept away. The other two men survived. On Thursday, 50-year-old James Wilke of Columbus, Nebraska, died when a bridge collapsed as he used a tractor to try and reach stranded motorists. A Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away. Water also swept away a man after a dam collapse. Both men are still missing.",2019-03-17

EN2406620,https://www.irinnews.org/news/2019/01/09/Sudan-Bashir-food-protests-bread,,"GENEVA

For weeks, popular protests have rocked Sudan, with thousands of citizens coming out to decry the high cost of bread and call for the downfall of the regime of President Omar al-Bashir, who has been in power since 1989.

Echoing the 2011 Arab Spring in neighbouring Libya and Egypt, demonstrations have spread across the country, from agricultural towns and old industrial centres to major cities like the capital, Khartoum. With the governing system already weakened by years of instability, some analysts say if al-Bashir falls it could bring down the state as a whole.

Al-Bashir, wanted by the International Criminal Court for allegedly committing genocide in Sudan’s western Darfur region, has responded with a crackdown by security forces that human rights groups say resulted in the deaths of dozens of protesters, although official figures are lower. He is holding tight to power, but the protesters won’t back down either, saying the regime’s time is up.

As a strategically located oil-producing nation, Sudan is crucial to the volatile geopolitics of the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa. But it reels from a sunken economy, widespread corruption, and protracted conflicts and humanitarian crises.

At least 5.5 million people are in need of assistance and two million internally displaced – mostly in Darfur, and in the southern Blue Nile and South Kordofan states, where rebellions continue and a ceasefire has just expired. In 2018, the UN estimated $1 billion in aid was required to assist everyone in need.

As protests continue – security forces reportedly fired on protesters in Sudan's second city of Omdurman on Wednesday – it’s unclear what impact the political upheaval will have on those already most vulnerable. Here’s our briefing on recent events in Sudan, and how the turbulence could impact the country.

Why did the protests start?

The immediate cause of the protests, which began on 19 December 2018, was the slashing of bread subsidies in the northern Nile-side town of Atbara. Citizens saw the price of bread triple overnight and took to the streets, burning down the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) headquarters, and breaking into stores to distribute grain to the people.

The protests quickly spread across the rural north, soon reaching the major cities of Port Sudan, Wad Madani, and Khartoum. Protesters called for an end to al-Bashir's 29-year reign, which has been marked by near-constant civil war, extreme hunger and famine in 1993 and 1998, and persistent economic malaise following the secession of the oil-rich south in 2011.

What’s unique about these protests?

Demonstrations started in the riverine north, which is traditionally al-Bashir's base, a departure from historical protest movements that typically began in cosmopolitan Khartoum. These protests are also different because of their longevity and geographic scope.

In 2013, Khartoum erupted in protests against the lifting of fuel subsidies, resulting in a furious response by security forces who killed nearly 200 people. Since then, economic conditions have only worsened as the country suffers from acute shortages of cash and fuel.

""[The regime] has clearly run out of political and economic ideas,"" said Horn of Africa expert Harry Verhoeven. ""Since 2011 people have known the time is up, it's a question of when rather than if. What we're seeing right now might not be the final chapter, but we are nearing the end.""

Who are the protesters and what do they want?

The protesters are a mix of rural people unable to afford basic goods and an urban middle class including students, university professors, and doctors demanding political overhaul . These groups are not necessarily natural partners, Magdi el Gizouli, a Sudanese analyst with the Rift Valley Institute, told IRIN.

""I do sense they may be laying off the live ammunition a bit more now because they feel under more scrutiny internationally.""

El Gizouli points to an attempt by urban protesters to downplay the importance of high food costs in rural areas. ""The middle class likes to speak of rights and freedoms. They don't like to speak the language of bread,"" he said. ""This contradiction is totally unnecessary. Why do you need to divide these two things? Why do you need to say bread is different from freedom?""

Despite this urban-rural divide, the protesters now have a semblance of structure under the emerging Sudanese Professionals Association, which has taken on an organisational role. In a petition, the Association has called for a “transitional government of technocrats with a mandate agreed upon by all segments of Sudanese society”.

How has the government responded?

Initially, al-Bashir's forces responded brutally, beating protesters and firing tear gas and live ammunition, which caused the deaths of at least 37 protesters in December, according to Amnesty International.

But the level of deadly violence has apparently lessened since then, with Human Rights Watch putting the total death toll at around 40. Sudan's government says 19 people have been killed.

The relative restraint may be the result of a warming of relations between Sudan and the West, says Jehanne Henry, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. Khartoum has become a key partner for the EU to stem the flow of migrants to the Mediterranean, and works on counter-terrorism with the United States, which lifted two decades of economic sanctions in 2017 amid a thaw in relations. ""I do sense they may be laying off the live ammunition a bit more now because they feel under more scrutiny internationally,"" Henry told IRIN.

That said, bellicose rhetoric from top officials suggests al-Bashir won’t go down without a fight, and Henry added that the regime is hardly playing nice. She pointed to reports of arrests (over 800 so far, according to the government) including of journalists, opposition politicians, and university professors.

Henry was especially concerned about 50 Darfuri students who she said were arrested, accused by authorities of having links to rebel groups, and held incommunicado. ""The government rounded them up in these house raids. They won't say where they are. There haven't been any charges,"" she said. ""That worries me because Darfuri students are always beaten up and treated horribly, much worse than other groups of protesters.""

Is there a political solution?

The protests have led to a realignment of Sudanese politics. A collection of smaller parties, including some of al- Bashir’s Islamist former allies, have left the government and joined the protesters’ calls for the president to step down. More traditional opposition parties, as well as rebel groups from Darfur, Kordofan and Blue Nile, have likewise voiced support for the protests.

But many of these groups represent an old guard that lacks credibility among Sudan's younger generation, who is in the streets. “Whatever way you look at it, [the protests] will move politics in Sudan a bit forward,” said el Gizouli. “But there's no one with a plan.”

So far, al-Bashir shows no signs of stepping down in the face of the defections, and there is little evidence the NCP itself is cracking: no major security figures have joined the protests.

However, continued support for al-Bashir isn’t a given. He essentially relies on a large patronage network to keep his power base behind him. And as the country is almost broke, it has become harder for him to keep everyone in line.

With no solution in sight, one thing is clear, according to Henry of Human Rights Watch: ""The longer the protests go on, the higher the death and injury toll.""

How is the international community reacting?

Al-Bashir is known for his wily approach to foreign relations, seeking out support wherever he can. But the international community has been hands-off in recent weeks.

Once a friend of Iran and a foe of the West, in recent years al-Bashir has simultaneously courted Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United States, Russia, and even Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Analysts say Egypt and the Gulf states would abhor an Arab Spring-style revolution in Sudan, but so far no Arab state has bailed al-Bashir out with an influx of cash – something he's relied on in the past.

Otherwise, there has been a smattering of statements calling for restraint from Western powers, the UN, and the African Union. The East African regional bloc IGAD, itself dominated by autocrats who fear popular uprisings, has said nothing. For el Gizouli, the way forward must come from within. ""The decisive thing is how the street continues to operate and how the security forces respond,” he said.

What will happen next?

According to Verhoeven, the best-case scenario to resolve the crisis would see al-Bashir step aside and go into exile while an internationally backed coalition government leads the country until fresh elections. But convincing al-Bashir to go is a tall order. Sudanese billionaire Mo Ibrahim suggested the ICC should think about dropping its charges against al-Bashir to encourage him to step aside with the guarantee he won’t be prosecuted.

But removing al-Bashir may do little to change the structure of the state if the security apparatus holds onto power, similar to Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's Egypt. Furthermore, the Sudanese state is weak after decades of war and sanctions.

""Structurally speaking, where Sudan is in this moment in time is not very different from [the Democratic Republic of] Congo in the mid 90s, or Somalia in the late 80s,"" Verhoeven said, referring to periods preceding massive outbreaks of violence in those countries. ""The system has become so weak and the state doesn't require very much to come crashing down, so when the leader falls, it's not just a person or a party that falls, it’s the state as a whole.""

It is easy to see how state collapse following a revolution could result in a situation like neighbouring Libya, where atrocities, warlordism, and terrorism have spread.

Verhoeven points out that grudges and rivalries run deep in Sudan, where there are many aggrieved groups who want to seek revenge. Al-Bashir's regime has also mainstreamed elements of Islamist extremism, and the country is awash with weapons.

So far, the protests have had little discernible impact on humanitarian aid; the ICRC told IRIN that none of its humanitarian activities have been disrupted as a result. But short of state collapse, the unrest at Sudan’s centre will invariably have consequences in the periphery, where the majority of vulnerable, aid-dependent people reside.

With all eyes on the protests, a ceasefire announced by al-Bashir last year for the Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile conflict areas quietly expired on 1 January. As al-Bashir moves troops to deal with the protests, rebels may take the opportunity to launch new offensives. At the same time, al-Bashir may need to buy loyalty of various militia and military elite, giving those armed groups and leaders the funds to rearm, recruit, and re-engage with their own rivals in the hinterlands. Any uptick in fighting could reverse hard-won gains for aid workers trying to reach civilians in need.

EN2567881,https://www.newdelhitimes.com/100-million-in-path-of-major-cyclone-headed-for-india/,,"More than 100 million people are in the path of Cyclone Fani as it slowly moves toward the eastern Indian state of Odisha.

Indian authorities have evacuated more than 1.2 million people from the coastal, low-lying areas and plan to move thousands more before the cyclone makes landfall, likely Friday afternoon.

“We are maximizing efforts at all levels for evacuation,” Odisha’s Special Relief Commissioner Bishnupada Sethi said.

As of early Thursday, the storm was churning in the Bay of Bengal. It is expected to make landfall with winds of 170-180 kilometers per hour and gusts of up to 200 kph, according to the latest forecast.

Fani has intensified significantly over the past couple of days, prompting the India Meteorological Department to refer to it as an “extremely severe cyclonic storm.”

Cyclone tracker Tropical Storm Risk rated Fani as a category 4 storm, a notch below the worst level. Red warnings, the highest level, have been issued for extremely heavy rainfall and dangerous sea conditions Friday in Odisha and Saturday in West Bengal.

Officials also are asking tourists to leave the coastal city of Puri, home of the 13th-century Konarak Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Jagganath Temple, one of the most holy in Hinduism.

Two major eastern ports, Paradip and Visakhapatnam, have been ordered to move ships out to sea to avoid damage. Flights have been canceled from midnight Thursday at the airport in Odisha’s capital, Bhubaneshwar, and for Kolkata Airport from 9:30 p.m. Friday, according to India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation.

Communities away from the coast also are on alert for heavy flooding. Rainfall of 20 to 25 centimeters is expected over a widespread area.

Eastern India is no stranger to deadly storms. In 1999, a supercyclone hit Odisha, killing more than 10,000 people. Four years later, the toll was significantly lower when Cyclone Phailin hit the state.

Because of improved forecasting and evacuation, more than 1.3 million people were moved out of harm’s way, resulting in a few dozen deaths, rather than thousands.

On Tuesday, Fani became the strongest storm in the north Indian Ocean this early in the season, passing Cyclone Nargis, which killed more than 100,000 people in Myanmar in 2008.

The north Indian Ocean cyclone season doesn’t have a defined start and end like the Atlantic hurricane season. Instead, it has two main periods of activity: late April to early June, and October to November.

Fani is the first cyclone of the 2019 season.

Flames and smoke rise from a fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 15, 2019. Photo: Bloomberg Photo By Martin Barzilai. Photo: Bloomberg Photo By Martin Barzilai. Image 1 of / 8 Caption Close Macron presides over rare unity as France grieves Notre Dame 1 / 8 Back to Gallery French citizens joined global leaders to rally behind Emmanuel Macron in the aftermath of a fire that ravaged the iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, giving the French President an opportunity to quell the political volatility that's embroiled his government. Macron vowed on Monday night to rebuild the 850-year-old Gothic monument, an issue that's united the French population across the political spectrum, with national parties suspending their European election campaigns and leaders from around the globe lending their support. The fire prompted the cancellation of a planned speech by the 41-year-old leader meant to allay the concerns of citizens angered over economic disparities and by a lack of trust in the political system. The address was an effort to move past months of protests by the Yellow Vests movement and bolster Macron's popularity, which had taken a battering from a public perception that he's out of touch and that his policies favor the rich. ""This is an opportunity for Macron to reach out to the opposition to create unity in a fractured, divided nation,"" said Bruno Cautres, a politics professor at Sciences Po institute, who cycles past the landmark every morning. ""He can't be seen as using this moment of widespread grief, but at the same time, people will expect all politicians to start working together, first for Notre Dame and hopefully, beyond Notre Dame."" The fire raged for about 12 hours, taking with it about two-thirds of the roof and its spire, and at one point late Monday night even the stone structure of the monument was at risk. The cause of the fire is still unknown but Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said nothing indicates it was started deliberately. Paris prosecutors opened a non-criminal investigation, a common step in such a major incident. The entire structure was a half-hour away from collapsing before firemen prevented the blaze from engulfing the bell towers, according to Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez. Culture Minister Franck Riester said major treasures such as the ""Crown of Thorns"" and Louis IX's tunic were removed to City Hall, while other relics were taken to the Louvre. The altars weren't burned but will be removed to be treated for smoke damage, while the rose windows appeared to have escaped major damage, he said. The initial budget to restore the cathedral before the fire was about 150 million euros ($170 million), and may need to be increased to about 450 million euros now, according to Michel Picaud, president of the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris. Money has already started to arrive for a rebuilding that will take years if not decades. The Paris region has unblocked 10 million euros ($11.5 million) in emergency funding. The Pinault family of Gucci owner Kering SA announced it was giving 100 million euros and the Arnault family that controls LVMH said it pledged 200 million euros. In his canceled speech, Macron had been expected to announce middle class income tax cuts, indexation of small pensions and the abolition of the elite ENA school for civil servants, in an effort to assuage grassroots discontent, French media reported. The fire comes a a little over a month before France is due to elect its members of the European Parliament. According to Ifop's daily rolling poll, Macron's La Republique en Marche! party and Marine Le Pen's euro-skeptic National Rally are tied at 21.5 percent, with the Republicans in third place at 13 percent. In the latest Ipsos poll, Macron's approval rating fell 1 point to 27 percent. In the week leading up to Monday, political leaders from opposition parties were on television saying Macron's measures wouldn't be up to the task, even without knowing what he was due to announce. Hours later they were all expressing their sadness at France's incalculable artistic loss. ""For two years, all we've had are tortured words that go around in circles, and when we get to the finish line there's nothing there,"" Laurent Wauquiez, head of The Republicans, the largest opposition party in Parliament, said Sunday on BFM TV. Monday night he wrote on Twitter that ""it's a whole part of our history, of all of us, that burns tonight."" He canceled an EU election rally he was due to attend in the southern city of Nimes Tuesday night. Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party and one of Macron's most scathing critics, said ""This building is like a member of our family. For at least 24 hours I can't feel and act like a politician."" Macron will have to walk a fine line, and tragic incidents throughout Europe have proven to be pitfalls for leaders who miscalculated the political severity of the events. British Prime Minister Theresa May had to admit that her initial handling of the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire, which killed at least 80 people in a London apartment block, was ""not good enough"" because she hadn't met victims on her first visit. Francois Hollande, who was president in 2015 when a terrorist rampage left 12 dead in France, saw his flagging popularity revive after the incident. Hollande oversaw a manhunt and brought international statesmen and millions of voters together in a show of political force, which earned him a temporary boost in his approval ratings. Leaders from around the world expressed their solidarity with Paris, including Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Macron will speak later Tuesday with Pope Francis, after having talked earlier with U.S. President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, whose populist government has been at odds with Macron, reached across the political divide. ""A thought and a hug for the people of Paris,"" Salvini wrote on Twitter. ""From Italy, all of our friendship and all the help we can give.""",2019-04-16

EL PASO, Texas – The photos showed migrant families fenced in under an international bridge, huddled against the cold, their children shawled in Mylar blankets.

The images, which captured national attention in March, sparked criticism about the treatment of those seeking refuge and asylum in the country. Federal officials issued statements saying they would transfer the families to a ""location with more space and shelter capability.""

Three months later, a makeshift detention camp still occupies a parking lot at the foot of the northbound Paso del Norte international bridge in downtown El Paso.

Mylar blankets were tied to a fence last week to jimmy a narrow shelter against the sun and rain. Trash clung to the chain link. A migrant washed clothes in a 5-gallon bucket one afternoon, as thunderheads threatened in the distance. On Sunday, three Cuban detainees shouted to an El Paso Times reporter that they had been held outside for a month.

""There is no justification for detaining people in this condition,"" said Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), who visited the site Friday. ""The current situation is absolutely unacceptable for the migrants and for the agents who work for the federal government, as well.""

Border Patrol denied an El Paso Times request that sought access to the detention camp. But Escobar described conditions as ""terrible."" Many of the migrants, a majority of whom are from Cuba, have been held outside for weeks, without access to cots, showers or basic hygiene, she said.

'In limbo': At US-Mexico border, migrants from Africa, Haiti wait to seek asylum

The parking lot-turned-detention camp is in plain view of border residents and tourists descending the international bridge from Mexico, who are now often waiting in long lines. Hundreds of customs officers have been pulled to Border Patrol to help with the influx.

During three visits to the bridge over seven days last week, the camp appeared consistently packed with migrants. Border Patrol installed camouflage netting over the area for shade late last week, as June temperatures headed toward triple digits.

The Office of the Inspector General slammed U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security last month for conditions at the detention center. It found that although CBP management had been aware of the situation for months, the issues have not been resolved.

The report warned that hygiene was a serious concern and both migrants and agents were at risk.

'Nothing we can do about it'

El Paso Sector Border Patrol spokesman Ramiro Cordero said children are no longer being held in the camp and are instead being housed at a different detention area on the city's Northeast El Paso – a sprawling tent facility erected to process 500 people.

He declined to provide a number of detainees but confirmed the overcrowding at the Paso del Norte bridge detention center, saying, ""There is no way for us to say there’s not a lot of people there.""

""If we’re apprehending over 1,000 a day, where do you put them?"" he said. ""The solution is not more agents or infrastructure or vehicles. You can build 10,000 tents but if people keep coming at the rate that they have, and the system is bottle-necked, there is nothing we can do about it.""

The Border Patrol has maintained that it's up to Congress to change immigration law.

Last week, under threat of tariffs from the Trump administration, the Mexican government agreed to step up enforcement to stem the flow of Central Americans and other migrants over its southern border and pledged to send 6,000 national guard troops.

Dylan Corbett, executive director of El Paso's Hope Border Institute, an immigrant advocacy group, blames CBP for repeatedly claiming there are no good solutions.

""It’s a challenging and stressful situation but the fact is, there is an entrenched culture of not respecting people’s human rights,"" Corbett said. ""We need to change strategy. No. 1 is recognizing this is a humanitarian issue.""

CBP spokesman Carlos Diaz, who is based in Washington, D.C., declined to answer questions regarding the overcrowding or the length of time migrants are being held by Border Patrol.

'Dangerous overcrowding': 900 migrants cram into Border Patrol center designed for 125 people

The agency's own standards require migrants not be held longer than 72 hours in Border Patrol custody before being transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or released.

He cited DHS' response to the OIG findings contained in the report, in which DHS says it intends to open a ""centralized processing center"" in El Paso by November 2020 with capacity to hold 1,800 people.

In its report, the OIG called that answer ""partially responsive"" and warned again that conditions ""represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of detainees and DHS employees.""

Migrant influx an 'ongoing crisis' in the Borderland

Border Patrol's El Paso Sector has seen the steepest increase in apprehensions between October and May this fiscal year, straining the agency's ability to respond.

The number of family groups turning themselves into border agents in West Texas and New Mexico ballooned in the first eight months of the fiscal year to more than 104,000, from fewer than 5,000 in the same period a year ago. (Texas' Rio Grande Valley is still Border Patrol's busiest, with more than 135,000 migrant families apprehended since October.)

Apprehensions of unaccompanied migrant children surged in the El Paso Sector to more than 13,000 from about 3,000 in the prior-year period.

Many of the families and children aren't trying to sneak across the border; they are turning themselves into agents. Whether or not they claim ""credible fear"" of returning to their home country – a first step in the asylum process – many migrants come with stories of fleeing poverty, political turmoil and gang violence.

Thirty percent of migrants claimed ""credible fear"" in fiscal 2018 at ports of entry; just 14% of those apprehended by Border Patrol made the claim.

Those arriving from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador or Cuba – ""non-contiguous"" countries whose borders don't touch the U.S. – cannot be turned back quickly or easily, since each nation must issue travel documents before their citizen is deported.

""This ongoing crisis has placed a tremendous strain on our limited resources and operational effectiveness,"" said acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders in a recent call with reporters.",2019-06-12

A husband and wife and their two granddaughters have been killed in an attack on Bolon, a town in Demsa Local Government Area of Adamawa State.

Witnesses said on Thursday evening that the armed killers descended on the town about 10 pm on Wednesday, shooting and burning down houses.

The village head of the affected town, Robinson Filgona, said: “Over one hundred households in my community are now homeless because their houses have been burnt down.

“Our food stuffs have also been burnt to ashes just like that. If you go round town now, you will see several of our houses are still on fire.”

The village head added: “At about 10 pm, the Fulani militants descended on our community heavily armed and started shooting at everyone they could see.





“We quickly mobilised to defend our lives and property but all we have are just our local bows and arrows, so they overpowered us. In fact, it is because of the resistance we mounted that you still see some few houses standing.”

The member-elect from the Demsa LGA, Kate Mamuno, corroborated the village head’s account.

He said: “This is the third time this community has been attacked by this murderous group and yet they go away without being apprehended by the security people. Almost three quarters of the village has been burnt down.”

The Police Public Relations Officer for the state, Othman Abubakar, said although he had been informed of the attack, he was yet to get the details of it.

Demsa is a neighbouring LGA to Numan, an LGA about 45 minutes’ drive to the state capital, Yola, where gunmen attacks have been frequent in the last couple of months and years.",2019-04-18

EN2889348,https://www.centralmaine.com/2019/11/03/lewiston-stars-in-two-offerings-at-bates-film-festival/,,"LEWISTON – A week after a 2018 brawl at Kennedy Park left one man dead and the community roiling, two Harvard University seniors rolled into town with the idea of making a documentary about its ethnic and racial divisions.

One of them, David Shayne, said Friday he “will never forget that first impression, that first feeling of walking around” in a place he’d never visited before, seeing the classic old mills and the cultural splashes of a remade city.

He called it “a pretty unique American experience” — an experience the two men delved into for their 18-minute movie “Lewiston,” which will be shown at the Bates Film Festival on Thursday.

Another film on tap the same day, “A Shared Space – Lewiston,” offers an “immersive 360-degree experience” that follows two people “who were raised in a refugee camp in eastern Kenya but now call Lewiston home.”

For their film “Lewiston,” Shayne teamed up with Harvard classmate Jacob Roberts, who said he was familiar with Lewiston because his cousin works for the fire department. So he knew about its Somali community and some of the friction that’s perhaps inevitable when thousands of refugees arrive in a small city.

The filmmakers’ goal, Roberts said, was to create “a portrait of the town” and some of its people, not something focused on that one bad night downtown.

It’s not a long movie so it captures only glimpses of a few people and places, providing a sense of their lives, particularly one friend of the dead man trying to deal with his grief.

Roberts, a Washington, D.C. native, said living in the city and making the documentary during the summer before their final year of college was “a strange and intensely emotional experience” for both men.

Shayne, who is from Tennessee, said it helped reinforce the idea of just how complicated stories can be in real life, how they wax and wane.

Plus, he said, “stories don’t really end,” but movies must.

“Lewiston” will be shown as one of four short documentaries at 4 p.m. Thursday in Room 104 at Olin Hall at the college.

The virtual reality screening is slated to air in Chase Hall’s Room B18 from 1-3 p.m. Thursday.

The entire festival at Bates, which includes 25 films, is free and open to the public. It runs from Wednesday to Sunday. Details are available online at bates.edu/bff.

(AP) — The Latest on an overturned cargo ship off the coast of Georgia (all times local): 6:10 p.m. The fourth and last crew member trapped inside a capsized cargo ship off the coast of Georgia has been rescued. Coast Guard Lt. Lloyd Heflin told The Associated Press in a text message that the South Korean crew member was rescued just before 6 p.m. Monday. He says the crew member appears to be in good medical condition but is being evaluated. Three other crew members were rescued earlier Monday from the Golden Ray. ___ 4 p.m. U.S. Coast Guard officials say they have rescued three of four crew members from an overturned cargo ship off the coast of Georgia, but they're still working on a plan to rescue a fourth crew member trapped on another deck. Capt. John Reed says at least two of the South Korean men who were extracted from a hole drilled in the hull of Golden Ray were able to walk with assistance down to a waiting boat. All three are being examined by medical personnel. Reed says the three men have seen the fourth person, who is trapped behind glass in the ship's engineering compartment. He says marine engineers are working on a plan to get him out. The rescue came 36 hours after the Golden Ray flipped onto its side and caught fire Sunday as it left Brunswick, Georgia, with more than 4,000 vehicles inside. ___ 3:15 p.m. The U.S. Coast Guard says it has rescued two of four trapped crew members from an overturned cargo ship off the coast of Georgia. Lt. Lloyd Heflin tells The Associated Press in a text message that two men have been extracted and rescuers are working on extracting a third. Heflin said the four South Koreans who were trapped aboard the Golden Ray are in the propeller shaft room near the stern of the ship and that rescuers cut into the hull there to pull them out. Responders made contact with crew members Monday morning, more than 24 hours after the vehicle carrier overturned while leaving a port call in Brunswick, Georgia. The Golden Ray flipped onto its side and caught fire Sunday as it left Brunswick with more than 4,000 vehicles inside. 1:20 p.m. The U.S. Coast Guard says it's developing a plan to extract four South Korean crew members trapped inside a cargo ship turned on its side off the coast of Georgia. Coast Guard Southeast says on Twitter that ""this is a slow, but safe process"" and that rescuers will deliver supplies through a hole drilled in the upturned hull of the Golden Ray. Lt. Lloyd Heflin told The Associated Press that responders made contact with crew members Monday morning, more than 24 hours after the vehicle carrier overturned while leaving a port call in Brunswick, Georgia. The Golden Ray flipped onto its side and caught fire Sunday as it left Brunswick with more than 4,000 vehicles inside. South Korea's Foreign Ministry has said the four crew members were in the engine room of the ship. ___ 11 a.m. The U.S. Coast Guard says rescuers have drilled through the hull of an overturned cargo ship and made contact with four missing crew members stuck inside. Lt. Lloyd Heflin tells The Associated Press that the contact came Monday morning after rescuers rappelled down the side of the ship. Heflin says ""the early indication is they are on board and OK."" He says the initial rescue team has faced a language barrier in communicating with the South Korean crew members. Heflin says rescuers are trying to figure out the safest way of getting them out. The Golden Ray flipped onto its side and caught fire Sunday as it left the Port of Brunswick with more than 4,000 vehicles inside. ___ 10:20 a.m. South Korea's Foreign Ministry says four crew members are in the engine room of their overturned cargo ship awaiting help from a U.S. Coast Guard rescue team. The foreign ministry's statement also says the fire that prevented a rescue attempt is now extinguished. Coast Guard Lt. Kit Pace said Monday that rescuers have been able to board the ship. The statement says 10 South Koreans, 13 Filipinos were on board, along with a U.S. harbor pilot, when the Golden Ray began tilting over in the shipping channel. The Hyundai Glovis company uses Georgia's Port of Brunswick to ship Kia and Hyundai vehicles along with other cars. The U.S. Coast Guard rescued 20 people but the fire and the instability of the overturned vessel kept them from venturing deep inside. The ministry statement said some of the missing South Koreans ""apparently tapped back three times"" after Coast Guard staff tapped on the hull. A Coast Guard spokesman told The Associated Press on Monday that rescuers heard noises but can't confirm they were signs of life without getting inside the overturned ship. ___ 9:55 a.m. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter has landed on the side of an overturned cargo ship off the Georgia coast, as the search for four missing crew members continues. The helicopter landed around 9 a.m. Monday on the hull of the Golden Ray, which rolled over Sunday in St. Simons Sound as it left the Port of Brunswick with a load of vehicles headed for Baltimore. Petty Officer 3rd class Ryan Dickinson told The Associated Press on Monday that rescuers heard noises but can't confirm that they're signs of life without going inside. The Coast Guard and others rescued 20 people from the ship early Sunday before fires and unstable cargo made it too risky to go inside. The ship is owned by South Korean firm Hyundai Glovis, which carries cars for automakers Hyundai and Kia as well as others. ____ 8:15 a.m. The U.S. Coast Guard says rescuers have heard noises from inside a cargo ship where four crew members are unaccounted for after their huge vessel overturned and caught fire off Georgia's coast. Petty Officer 3rd class Ryan Dickinson told The Associated Press on Monday that rescuers heard noises but can't confirm that they're signs of life without going inside. The flames and smoke have prevented rescuers from safely penetrating the unstable vessel.

Defence Minister Florence Parly said the weapons were to be loaded on to a Saudi cargo ship in the port of Le Havre.

The minister refused to identify the types of arms, but stressed France’s stance that they have been used only for defensive purposes by Saudi Arabia since it began its Yemen offensive in 2015.

“As far as the French government is aware, we have no proof that the victims in Yemen are the result of the use of French weapons,” Parly said.

There have been international calls for arms deals with Saudi Arabia to be halted as a result of its actions in Yemen which the UN has described as “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis”, with 3.3 million displaced by fighting and 24.1 million in need of aid.

UN investigators have also warned the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen has killed thousands of civilians in air strikes, tortured detainees, raped civilians and used child soldiers as young as eight, all of which may amount to war crimes.

Impoverished Yemen has remained in a state of civil war since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including the capital Sanaa.

In 2015, Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen’s embattled government.

It was gathered that some of the victims had suffered certain health challenges which their families termed spiritual and dumped them at the facility for divine healing.

At the time of this report, 12 of the victims had been rescued while efforts were on to evacuate the rest.

It was gathered that some of the victims could barely walk and were assisted out first.

This discovery is coming in the wake of police raid of various religious places where many people have been held captive for several years.

EN2707725,https://www.wrvo.org/post/lebanon-palestinians-protest-new-employment-restrictions,,"The skies above Lebanon have been filled with colorful balloons in recent days. They're not in celebration, but in protest, and bear the message ""Enough, we want dignity"" scrawled in Arabic in black marker. In recent weeks, thousands of Palestinian refugees have been holding demonstrations in 12 refugee camps across Lebanon to protest a government crackdown on businesses hiring foreign workers without permits. The demonstrators oppose a new Lebanese labor ministry rule requiring them to have special work permits. Under Lebanese law, everyone who is considered a foreigner must acquire certain paperwork from the Ministry of Labor in order to work. Palestinians — who were forced out or fled in the war during Israel's creation in 1948, and were not allowed back — now make up about 10% of Lebanon's population. Some 450,000 Palestinians are registered in Lebanon with the U.N. refugee agency that works with Palestinian refugees. Various Lebanese governments have classified Palestinians either as foreigners, refugees or stateless people, even though many were born in Lebanon. Palestinians are generally not granted Lebanese citizenship. ""The laws are so gray ... every time a new labor minister comes to office, we become afraid because they change what it means to be 'Palestinian' here,"" says Rana Makki, a 27-year-old Palestinian activist and researcher. Palestinian refugees ""are highly marginalized, with two-thirds considered poor or extremely poor,"" with a high rate of unemployment exacerbated by the arrival of more than 1 million Syrian refugees to Lebanon, according to a 2016 U.N. Refugee Agency report. Saber Halimeh, a 26-year-old Palestinian journalist who writes for a website covering refugee issues, grew up in the Burj al-Barajneh refugee camp on the outskirts of Beirut. In this loud, bustling camp, which has narrow alleyways lined with dangerous electrical wires, he explains that what spurred these protests — which began last week — was the government closure of two Palestinian-owned businesses amid a larger government crackdown on Syrian refugees. In June, the Labor Ministry, led by Camille Abousleiman, announced a one-month deadline for companies to acquire work permits for anyone considered a foreigner in Lebanon. Once the deadline expired last week, the ministry began to close or fine businesses that didn't have permits from the government, nearly 600 of them Syrian-run or employing Syrians, and two Palestinian. ""It's clear that they're clamping down on Syrians because they want to send them home. But where would we go? We were born here and have no land to return to,"" Makki says. In 2010, labor laws in Lebanon were amended to exempt Palestinian refugees from paying for work permits. However, Palestinian businesses still had to register with the government and pay a quarter of the standard registration fee. In a series of tweets, Abousleiman denied that the government is targeting Palestinians and has tried to ease tensions by vowing to facilitate the granting of work permits for Palestinian refugees. ""Lebanese law protects Palestinian workers and guarantees that they receive minimum wage,"" he tweeted. But the Palestinian protesters are demanding much more than an overturn of the new work permit rule. Palestinians in Lebanon are barred from working in more than 20 professions, and their prospects in the labor market are limited to jobs in construction, administrative roles and small crafts. In the protests, ""We're not just asking for the simple right to work anymore, but also to work [in] professions we are banned from, such as medicine, law [and] engineering,"" Halimeh says. The protest movement is also asking the Lebanese government to clarify Palestinians' status, he says. ""Foreigners come here voluntarily for work or tourism,"" he says. ""We are refugees without a choice or a place to return to."" Halimeh says it is illegal to allow building materials in the camp where he lives, because the Lebanese government wants to discourage Palestinians from staying permanently. ""We cannot own houses outside the camps, ownership of land is difficult for Palestinians in Lebanon, and we also cannot build inside the camps. We are asking to be allowed to at least bring in building materials. Palestinians have been here for 70 years,"" he says. The Ain el-Helweh camp, located about an hour's drive south of Beirut, in the city of Saida, has become the symbolic center of the protests, activists tell NPR. ""Inside Ain el-Helweh, there's one of the largest vegetable markets in Saida, and since the protests began, they've put a stop to all Lebanese products entering or leaving the camps,"" Halimeh says. ""They're trying to prove a point that Palestinians aren't a burden on Lebanese society. We actually contribute to the economy in a positive way."" Palestinians have set up a committee to to negotiate with the Lebanese government on ensuring working rights and defining their status as ""permanent residents."" Until an agreement is reached, Palestinian activists tell NPR they will continue to protest daily. ""There is big fear for my future. I cannot buy an apartment if I want to settle down and get married. No one guarantees my rights in the workforce. I don't have insurance from the workplace,"" Halimeh says. ""It's a dark cloud that constantly hangs above us, creating great worry for what the future will hold."" ",2019-07-26

U.S. NAVY 5TH FLEET BASE NEAR FUJAIRAH, United Arab Emirates — The limpet mines used to attack a Japanese-owned oil tanker near the Strait of Hormuz last week bore “a striking resemblance” to similar mines displayed by Iran, a U.S. Navy explosives expert said Wednesday, stopping short of directly blaming Tehran for the assault.

Iran has denied being involved in the attack last Thursday that hit the Japanese tanker Kokuka Courageous and also the Norwegian-owned Front Altair.

The comments by Cmdr. Sean Kido came as the Navy showed reporters pieces of debris and a magnet they say Iran's Revolutionary Guard left behind when they spirited away an unexploded limpet mine after the June 13 attack in the Gulf of Oman. Iran has also not acknowledged taking the mine.

play_circle_filled US releases photos to bolster claim Iran attacked tankers as 1,000 additional troops to be sent to Middle East In an effort to bolster its public case against Iran, the Pentagon on Monday released new photos that officials said show that members of Tehran’s Revolutionary Guard were responsible for attacks last week on two oil tankers near the Persian Gulf.

Kido also stressed that the damage done to the Kokuka Courageous was ""not consistent with an external flying object hitting the ship,"" despite the ship's owner blaming ""flying objects"" for the damage in the attack.

Meanwhile, a rocket hit an oil-drilling site in Iraq's southern Basra province early on Wednesday, striking inside a compound housing energy giant Exxon Mobil and other foreign oil companies and wounding three local workers, one seriously, Iraqi officials said.

The attack on the oil tankers came against the backdrop of heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran that take root in President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers a year ago.

Iran recently has quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium and threatened to boost its enrichment closer to weapons-grade levels, trying to pressure Europe for new terms to the 2015 deal.

Iran speeds up uranium enrichment as Mideast tensions mount Iran will surpass the uranium-stockpile limit set by its nuclear deal in the next 10 days, an official said Monday, raising pressure on Europeans trying to save the accord a year after the U.S. withdrawal lit the fuse for the heightened tensions now between Tehran and Washington.

In recent weeks, the U.S. has sped an aircraft carrier to the Mideast and deployed additional troops to the tens of thousands already here. Mysterious attacks also have targeted oil tankers as Iranian-allied Houthi rebels launched bomb-laden drones into Saudi Arabia.

All this has raised fears that a miscalculation or further rise in tensions could push the U.S. and Iran into an open conflict, some 40 years after Tehran's Islamic Revolution.

Journalists take pictures of a magnet the U.S. Navy says came from a limpet mine that didn't explode on a Japanese-owned oil tanker at a 5th Fleet base during a trip organized by the Navy for journalists, near Fujairah, United Arab Emirates, Wednesday, June 19, 2019. C(Kamran Jebreili/AP)

The U.S. Navy briefed foreign journalists on Wednesday at a 5th Fleet base near Fujairah, an Emirati port city some 210 kilometers (130 miles) northeast of the capital, Abu Dhabi. There, they showed journalists debris recovered from the Kokuka Courageous, which they described as including aluminum and composite metals.

They also showed a magnet they described as being left behind by the Revolutionary Guard — one of six apparently used to stick the unexploded limpet mine to the ship's hull. Sailors said it took two of them and a crowbar to pry it off the ship.

Those pieces put together have U.S. sailors suspecting the limpet mine came from Iran.

(Kamran Jebreili/AP)

They showed a picture previously shared among weapons experts of a limpet mine on display in Iran, which they said resembled the one they suspected was used on the ship. That picture showed a conical mine, some 42 kilograms (90 pounds) in weight, on display with a sign next to it identifying it as being produced by a research company affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard.

""The limpet mine that was used does bear a striking resemblance to that which has been publicly displayed in Iranian military parades,"" Kido said. ""There are distinguishing features.""

Kido declined to elaborate. Iran's mission to the U.N. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The mines were placed above the vessel's water line. One exploded, punching through the double-hulled ship and sparking a brief fire. The placement of the mines on the vessel makes it ""not appear that the intention was to sink the vessel,"" Kido said.

""The damage we observed is consistent with a limpet mine attack; it is not consistent with an external flying object hitting the ship,"" Kido said.

Authorities also recovered a hand print and fingerprints, he said. ""We recovered biometric information ... which can be used to build a criminal case to hold the individuals responsible accountable."" He did not offer more details.

The second vessel involved in the attack, the Norwegian-owned Front Altair, caught fire and sent black smoke up into the air that was visible from space by satellites. Kido did not explain why the U.S. had no immediate evidence from that vessel. Both are now anchored off the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates.

He also declined to discuss an earlier, May 12 attack on four oil tankers off the coast of Fujairah near the U.S. base, which America similarly blames on an Iranian limpet mine attack. Analysts also believe those attacks came from limpet mines.

What war with Iran could look like Military Times interviewed more than a dozen military experts, including current and former U.S. military officials, about how a conflict might begin and how it could play out. This is what they said could happen:

In Iraq on Wednesday, a Katyusha rocket landed at dawn in the Zubair and Rumeila oil fields camp, operated by the Iraqi Drilling company, where Exxon Mobil and other companies have caravans housing their workers, security official Mahdi Raykan said.

Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In May, it evacuated staff from the West Qurna 1 oil field in Basra province.

As Washington-Tehran tensions escalated, there have been concerns that Iraq could once again get caught in the middle between its two top allies. The country hosts more than 5,000 U.S. troops, and is home to powerful Iranian-backed militias, some of whom want those U.S. forces to leave.

In May, the U.S. evacuated nonessential diplomatic staff from Iraq. That came before a missile landed in Baghdad's Green Zone, near the sprawling U.S. Embassy.

No one claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack and Iraqi oil exports were unaffected.

The Statue of Liberty, New York / Photo: Pexels / (MGN)

After she did so, U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein spared Therese Okoumou from prison for her conviction on multiple misdemeanor counts though he berated her for what he thought was a lack of concern for rescuers whose safety he said she jeopardized.

As she stood before him with a white headband across her forehead scrawled with the phrase ""I care!"" he ordered her to perform 200 hours of community service and five years of probation, leading her attorney, Ron Kuby, to suggest the judge might be seeing a lot of them in the future.

""I think there's hope"" otherwise, the judge responded, saying he would be willing to shorten the probation term at a later point if Okoumou did not commit more crimes.

Given a chance to speak in court, Okoumou called the case against her ""a fraud against injustice,"" an explanation for her continuing protest and the tape she had earlier painfully pulled off her face.

""I'm not a criminal,"" she told Gorenstein.

When Gorenstein took a break from the bench before announcing the sentence, Okoumou stood and turned around to face several dozen supporters before raising her fist in the air.

The gesture silenced the supporters, who raised their fists in return as everyone stood for a moment before Okoumou blew a kiss to them and turned around to await her sentence.

Outside court, she was surrounded by supporters as she railed the immigration policies of the Trump administration, saying they're what prompted the Statue of Liberty protest.

""We have people in cages? What was I supposed to do?"" she said. ""I made my point. ... Find your own conscience. Don't look up to me.""

The nearly four-hour demonstration forced an evacuation of 4,330 people from the statue grounds on one of its busiest days of the year.

As he announced his sentence, Gorenstein noted that Okoumou repeatedly ignored orders to descend from a perch at the feet of the statue that was high enough that a prosecutor said it could have seriously injured or killed her or tourists below. New York Police Department rescuers were forced to climb a rickety ladder and gird themselves like mountain climbers to safely bring her down.

The judge said she tried to push down the ladder, jeopardizing rescuers.

Prosecutors noted in presentencing papers that since Okoumou's arrest, she has twice climbed the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, forcing its evacuation, and has climbed onto the roof of an Austin, Texas, building, leading to another arrest in which charges are pending.

The Texas climb led to her being subjected to electronic monitoring in New York, though Gorenstein ordered the removal of the device Tuesday.

Kuby said Gorenstein was overestimating the danger to rescuers posed by his client's statue climb. The lawyer called them the most elite rescuers ""on the planet.""

EN2510198,https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/world/helicopters-rescue-norway-cruise-ship-passengers-amid-storm,,"Rescue workers off Norway's western coast rushed to evacuate 1,300 passengers and crew from a disabled cruise ship by helicopter on Saturday, winching them one-by-one to safety as heaving waves tossed the ship from side to side and high winds battered the operation.

The Norwegian newspaper VG said the Viking Sky cruise ship issued a mayday call as bad weather hit Saturday and engine problems caused it to start drifting toward the rocky shore. Police in the western county of Moere og Romsdal said the crew, fearing the ship would run aground, managed to anchor in Hustadsvika Bay, between the Norwegian cities of Alesund and Trondheim, so the evacuations could take place.

Rescue teams with helicopters and boats were sent to evacuate the cruise ship under extremely difficult circumstances. Norwegian media reported gusts up to 38 knots (43 mph) and waves over 8 meters (26 feet) in an area known for its rough, frigid waters.

Video and photos from people on the ship showed it heaving, with chairs and other furniture dangerously rolling from side to side. Passengers were suited up in orange life vests but the waves broke some ship windows and cold water flowed over the feet of some passengers.

Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said the Viking Sky's evacuation was a slow and dangerous process, as passengers needed to be hoisted one-by-one from the cruise ship to the five available helicopters.

""I was afraid. I've never experienced anything so scary,"" Janet Jacob, among the first group of passengers evacuated to the nearby town of Molde, told NRK.

She said her helicopter ride to safety came amid strong winds ""like a tornado,"" prompting her to pray ""for the safety of all aboard.""

American passenger John Curry told NRK that he was having lunch as the cruise ship started to shake.

""It was just chaos. The helicopter ride from the ship to shore I would rather not think about. It wasn't nice,"" Curry told the broadcaster.

NRK said one 90-year-old-man and his 70-year-old spouse on the ship were severely injured but did not say how that happened.

Norwegian media said the majority of the cruise ship passengers were British and American tourists. By 6 p.m., some 100 people had been rescued and were being taken to a nearby sports hall.

Later, reports emerged that a cargo ship with nine crew members was in trouble nearby, and the local Norwegian rescue service diverted two of the five helicopters working on the cruise ship to that rescue.

Authorities told NRK that a strong storm with high waves was preventing rescue workers from using life boats or tug boats to take passengers ashore.

""It's a demanding exercise, because they (passengers) have to hang in the air under a helicopter and there's a very, very strong wind,"" witness Odd Roar Lange told NRK at the site.

Norwegian authorities said late Saturday that the evacuation would proceed all through the night into Sunday.

The Viking Sky was on a 12-day trip that began March 14 in the western Norwegian city of Bergen, according to the cruisemapper.com website.

The ship was visiting the Norwegian towns and cities of Narvik, Alta, Tromso, Bodo and Stavanger before its scheduled arrival Tuesday in the British port of Tilbury on the River Thames.

The Viking Sky, a vessel with gross tonnage of 47,800, was delivered in 2017 to operator Viking Ocean Cruises.

The head of the Customs and Border Protection agency is leaving, and his replacement probably won't warm the hearts of advocates for immigrants.

John Sanders, the acting CBP commissioner, resigned Tuesday amid reports of migrant children at the border being held in unsafe and filthy conditions.

His resignation comes as public furor has increased over the treatment of detained migrant kids after lawyers reported some of the older children were caring for toddlers at a facility in Clint, Texas, and they lacked adequate food, water and sanitation.

Sanders is expected to be replaced by Mark Morgan, a former Marine and FBI agent who has been leading Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for fewer than two months, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision has not been finalized.

Morgan served as chief of the Border Patrol in the final months of the Obama administration, but he has since become a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration-enforcement strategy.

He defended the president’s controversial decision to declare a national emergency to get funding to expand the southern border wall. “The president had no choice,” Morgan said during a February interview on CNN.

When announcing Morgan's appointment to head ICE on May 5, Trump called him “a true believer and American Patriot.”

And just last week, Morgan vowed to enforce Trump’s plan, which has since been delayed, to ramp up arrests and deportations of families that have entered the country and had their asylum requests denied.

“If you come here with a child, that’s a passport in the United States,” Morgan said on the PBS NewsHour. “Nothing happens to you. That’s a slippery slope, and no integrity in the system, and the rule of law is being eroded if we don’t apply consequences.”

Carla Provost, the head of U.S. Border Patrol, a component of CBP, was touring the border in Yuma, Arizona, on Tuesday when she learned of Sanders’ resignation. The incoming head of CBP will be Provost’s third boss since she took over the agency and its 19,500 agents in April of 2017.

Provost said the turnover at the top of CBP, and a broader leadership shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security, has not affected the work of Border Patrol agents as they deal with the ongoing surge of migrants crossing the southern border.

“I don’t see that as having an impact on our ability to do our jobs and fulfill our mission,” she said. “We have had support no matter what when it comes to the mission, when it comes to the crisis at hand in relation to the leadership.”

Raids on hold: Trump delays nationwide ICE raids to deport undocumented immigrants, allows Congress two weeks on deal

Morgan faces a stiff challenge as conditions on the southern border with Mexico have reached a crisis point with a surge of Central American migrants seeking asylum.

Sanders, who has overseen the agency responsible for border enforcement since April, said in a letter to employees that his resignation is effective July 5.

""Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful, I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of CBP has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career,"" Sanders wrote.

Trump said Tuesday at the White House that he did not ask Sanders to resign but was “very concerned” about conditions at migrant detainee facilities. He criticized Democrats for holding up funding for humanitarian aid on the border even as House leaders worked on getting that funding approved.

After threatening mass raids by ICE last week, Trump called them off and gave Congress two weeks to find a solution to the border crisis.

An official from CBP said Tuesday that the agency moved more than 100 children back to the Clint facility. The official said the “majority” of the roughly 300 children detained there last week have been placed in facilities operated by the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

The official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said Clint is better equipped than some of the Border Patrol’s tents to hold children.

Six children have died since late last year after being detained by CBP, the agency that apprehends and first detains migrant parents and children crossing the U.S.-Mexican border illegally.

On Tuesday, CBP issued a statement that said in part: ""CBP continues to utilize all available resources to prioritize and care for children in our custody and facilitate their expeditious transfer to HHS (Department of Health and Human Services) custody.''

Sanders pushed Congress to pass $4.5 billion in humanitarian funding. In an interview last week with The Associated Press, he talked about how the deaths impacted him ""profoundly.”

Sanders moved up from CBP's chief operating officer to acting commissioner when Kevin McAleenan left the position to replace Kirstjen Nielsen as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, also in an acting capacity.

""I will never stop defending the people and the mission for which 427 people gave their lives in the line of duty in defending,'' Sanders told employees in the letter. ""Hold your heads high with the honor and distinction that you so richly deserve.''

The pressure on CBP increased when the lawyers who visited facilities last week described squalid conditions to The Associated Press, such as lack of medical care and several children afflicted with the flu.

Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, said Sanders' resignation “adds fuel to the chaos at the Department of Homeland Security.""

""CBP is clearly failing to carry out its mission, given the Trump administration’s disastrous immigration policies,"" he said. ""It is quite clear that bad actors in the White House are doing all they can to strong-arm the Department of Homeland Security and stand in the way of any progress or agreeable solution. There is simply no excuse for the horrific conditions children and families are being held in at the border.''

The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he didn’t know why Sanders resigned, but that a new CBP director would be needed every few months if conditions along the border don’t improve.

""Money will help,'' Graham said. ""But if you don’t stop the reason they’re coming from Central America, you better get ready to do this every three or four months. To my House colleagues, making conditions better at the border: great. But you’ve got to stop the pull factors. If there’s no change in the pull factors, it’s just throwing good money after bad.”

All aboard the trash train.

A construction worker headed out to work at about 4:45 a.m. boarded a disgusting #2 subway train in the Bronx last week.

“This is crazy!” the man said on the video posted on Instagram.

The squalor in the scene is marred with tragedy, as a man sat amongst the trash, bottles, newspapers, bags and assorted other items strewn across the car and a trash-filled shopping cart sat at the far end of the subway car.

“No one should ever have to experience this,” NYC Transit President Andy Byford said in a statement to Fox 5 News. He also said that it was a clear violation of subway rules.

Byford told Fox 5 News that the subway system works with the Deptartment of Homeless Services to ensure people who need help are connected to the services they need.

He also said that the NYPD had been alerted about the video, but a police spokesperson told Fox 5 News that in situations like this, they would take an emotionally disturbed person to the hospital or otherwise simply tell them to clean up the mess.",2019-05-14

The confirmed death toll in Zimbabwe, neighbouring Mozambique and Malawi surpassed 500, with hundreds more feared dead in towns and villages that were completely submerged. Aid agencies and several governments continued to step up their deployments, with helicopters in short supply for hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the cyclone. Spokesman Herve Verhoosel, of the World Food Programme (WFP), told reporters in Geneva of the “alarming news” that the Marowanyati dam in Zimbabwe was hit by heavy rains overnight, putting populations in the region at risk. Using WFP drones in the aftermath of #CycloneIdai to assess infrastructure damage in urban and remote areas helps provide first responders with a clearer picture of some of the challenges that lie ahead – when every minute counts. pic.twitter.com/ZuLNEQ77FM — World Food Programme (@WFP) March 21, 2019 Zimbabwe’s defence minister said more than 120 bodies had been washed into neighbouring Mozambique, where residents there buried them, and more bodies were still being recovered in rivers, raising the official death toll in the country to 259. “Most of the bodies were washed into Mozambique and because they were in a really bad state, they could not keep the bodies,” defence minister Oppah Muchinguri said, speaking in the eastern city of Mutare. “So they ended up burying them.” Meanwhile, the confirmed death toll in Mozambique rose to 217, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported, and in Malawi, at least 56 people were killed. But that was sure to rise. Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi has estimated that 1,000 people could have been killed in his country alone. Zimbabwean officials have said some 350 people may have died in their country. Homes, villages and entire towns were submerged across central Mozambique, where flooding created a muddy inland ocean 30 miles wide. The UN food aid agency said 400,000 people were displaced and “in urgent need of life-saving assistance” in Mozambique’s coastal city of Beira and flooded areas along the Pungue and Buzi rivers. A section of road damaged by Cyclone Idai in Nyamatanda, about 50km from Beira in Mozambique (Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP) The persistent rains lifted in some areas on Thursday, and floodwaters began to recede in Beira, the worst-hit city, and in the countryside, according to a Mozambican government report. “Yesterday, 910 people were rescued by the humanitarian community,” said Caroline Haga, of the International Federation of the Red Cross in Beira. She said 210 were rescued by five helicopters and 700 were saved by boats. Aid groups were continuing to work non-stop to rescue families desperately clinging to tree branches and rooftops for safety from the surging waters. “A family saw their brick house swept away from them. When they went to another house for safety, the roof collapsed,” Machiel Pouw, Save the Children’s response team leader in Mozambique, said in a statement. “Another family fled for safety in a tree. There are tens of thousands of heartbreaking stories like this, lives shattered over the past days.” It will be days before Mozambique’s inundated plains drain towards the Indian Ocean and even longer before the full scale of the devastation is known. The WFP said Malawi’s government had reported more than 920,000 people in the country were affected by the floods. The agency said Idai had had a “limited impact” on Malawi, and projected that the number of affected people will decline as they return home. In Zimbabwe, 90% of the district of Chimanimani – the country’s hardest-hit – was significantly damaged, the agency said, estimating that 200,000 people would need food assistance over the next three months. Aid has been slow to reach affected villagers due to collapsed infrastructure, although the military has been handing out small packets of cooking oil, maize meal and beans.",2019-03-21

EN2496079,https://www.thedailystar.net/asia/news/flash-floods-kill-58-indonesia-papua-1716382,,"Flash floods and landslides triggered by torrential rain in Indonesia's easternmost province of Papua have killed at least 58 people, injured dozens and displaced more than 4,000, authorities said today.

-Baby pulled alive from under collapsed house, says spokesman -Disaster agency: Deforestation has made area vulnerable

A search for more possible victims was under way in the town of Sentani, which was hit by flash floods late on Saturday. Fifty-one people were killed and 74 injured there, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the national disaster agency, told a news briefing.

Heavy rain caused landslides in the nearby provincial capital of Jayapura, killing seven there, Nugroho said.

Soldiers pulled alive a 5-month old baby from under the rubble of his house and took him to hospital, Papua military spokesman Muhammad Aidi said.

The number of victims ""will probably increase because the evacuation process is still taking place and not all affected areas have been reached,"" Nugroho said.

About 4,150 people are sheltering in six evacuation centres, he said.

Hundreds of houses, three bridges and a Twin Otter airplane parked at the airport were damaged by the floods. The Sentani airport, the province's main transport hub, remained open.

TV footage showed mud and large logs on Sentani's main roads after floodwaters receded.

Disaster authorities have warned local governments of flash flood risks due to deforestation in the mountains surrounding the town, Nugroho said, adding that in 2018 Jakarta sent seedlings intended for tree-planting.

""Forest destruction in the Cyclops mountains have increased for use as firewood and to turn the land into plantations,"" Nugroho said.

""Since 2018 we have warned the Jayapura government to be careful of flash flood risks because of this deforestation,"" he added.",2019-03-17

U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in California issued the preliminary injunction blocking the new asylum restrictions Wednesday afternoon, just hours after a hearing where he grilled a government attorney over the new sweeping change to asylum policy. The article goes on to state the following: The policy, announced by the Trump administration last week, would broadly end asylum eligibility for migrants who pass through another country on their journey to the United States’ southern border with Mexico but do not attempt to seek the protection in those other countries first. Tigar wondered if countries like Mexico and Guatemala had the ability to process asylum-seekers, saying that in Mexico “applications are up dramatically” but there was no way to know if Mexico could handle the volume of asylum-seekers that might make claims.

EN2562104,https://thediplomat.com/2019/04/russia-kicks-off-work-on-2-guided-missile-frigates-for-indian-navy/,,"Advertisement

Russia’s Yantar shipyard in Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast has officially begun work on two modified Admiral Grigorovich-class (Project 1135.6P/M) guided-missile frigates destined for service in the Indian Navy, the press office of Russia’s state arms exporter Rosoboronexport reported on April 26.

“Rosoboronexport sees the Yantar Shipyard’s big potential for developing and producing hi-tech products supplied as part of military and technical cooperation, the state arms exporter’s press office quoted Rosoboronexport CEO Alexander Mikheyev as saying. “Its capacities have already produced hardware for exports worth over $1 billion and today the Shipyard has started fulfilling one of the largest contracts for India’s Navy.”

Under an inter-governmental agreement signed between India and Russia in October 2016, two frigates are slated to be built at the Yantar shipyard in Kaliningrad, while the remaining two frigates will be assembled at India’s state-owned Goa shipyard with technical support from Moscow. The four ships are expected to be delivered to the Indian Navy by 2026.

India and Russia signed a contract for the procurement of the first batch of two Admiral Grigorovich-class guided-missile frigates in October 2018. A follow-on contract for the construction of the second batch of warships of the class in India was inked in January 2019.

“The follow-on P 1135.6 series of frigates, customized to meet the Indian Navy’s specific requirements, are potent platforms, with a mission span covering the entire spectrum of naval warfare; air, surface and sub-surface,” the Indian Ministry of Defense said in a statement following the conclusion of the January 2019 contract.

“The ships would be equipped to operate in littoral and blue waters; both as a single unit and as consorts of a naval task force. Advanced features of stealth include a special hull design, to limit radar cross-section, low electromagnetic, infrared and under water noise signatures. The ships would carry highly sophisticated and state-of-art weapon systems and sensors.”

Admiral Grigorovich-class surface combatants are an upgraded variant of the six Talwar-class frigates that Russia built for the Indian Navy between 2003 and 2013. Displacing 3,620 tons, the frigates are reportedly capable of reaching top speeds of 30 knots and reportedly have an endurance of around 30 days. As I reported back in February:

The frigates will be armed with the BrahMos cruise missile system fired from an eight-cell 3S-14E under-deck launcher. The two-stage BrahMos missile — named after the Brahmaputra River in India and the Moskva River in Russia – is a derivative of the Russian-made P-800 Oniks over-the-horizon supersonic anti-ship cruise missile. In July 2018, Indian defense firm Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has also unveiled a quadruple canisterized inclined launcher for the BrahMos missile for Indian Navy surface warships. The ships of the class will also carry vertical-launched 3M-54 Kalibr missiles. The 3M-54 Kalibr is Russian-made stand-off supersonic anti-ship cruise missile. Other armaments include a 100-millimeter A-190 naval cannon, 533-millimeter heavyweight torpedoes, and ant-submarine rockets. The frigates also feature a flight deck to carry a helicopter for anti-submarine warfare missions.

Notably, the Indian MoD is set to procure two M90FR gas turbine engines, designed and built by Zorya-Mashproekt, for the two frigates to be built in India directly from Ukraine as a result of a military export ban imposed by the Ukrainian government on Russia in 2014. While Russia’s defense industry has been tasked with building copies of the M90FR gas turbine engine, a new engine is not expected to be ready before 2020, which could delay construction of the third and fourth Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates in India.",2019-04-30

We are not addressing the systemic issue. The systemic issue is that people are homeless. Wayne Renkin, Acting chairperson - Tshwane Leadership Foundation

EN2564599,https://wfin.com/abc-world-news/actor-ben-stiller-speaks-out-on-syria-as-us-warns-of-intensifying-violence/,,"Paul Morigi/Getty Images(WASHINGTON) — In over eight years of war, the headlines of suffering and violence in Syria have, at times, faded. Actor Ben Stiller tried to change that on Wednesday. The goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees testified in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the humanitarian impact of the war and what the U.S. should be doing about it. It couldn’t come at a more critical time. There are rising concerns of intense fighting in the country’s northwest province Idlib — the last rebel stronghold that’s in the crosshairs of strongman Bashar al Assad and his backers Russia and Iran, but also a hub of terror groups like al-Qaeda’s affiliate. For those areas liberated from the Islamic State, there are major questions about what comes next as the Trump administration plans to draw down its troop levels and has pulled funding and called for other countries to pay for stabilization projects critical to restoring services and keeping terror groups at bay. During his testimony, Stiller turned quickly to how watching the refugee crisis galvanized him to act: “I didn’t want to just keep watching. I wanted to do something.” “Eight years into this crisis, we must not look away,” he said, praising the work of the U.N. refugee agency, but said it is lacking the resources needed to address the crisis. “Given severe underfunding, there is nothing easy about making daily difficult choices, like which programs to downsize or which families won’t receive thermal blankets during a cold, harsh winter,” he added. Since the conflict began, the U.S. has provided around $9 billion for humanitarian aid, according to the State Department. But the Trump administration has pulled back — asking others to pay more, moving to withdraw U.S. troops, and refusing to provide funding to rebuild areas under Assad’s control. In March, the U.N. and European Union hosted a donor conference, securing pledges of up to $7 billion for humanitarian aid for Syria. Of that, $397 million came from the U.S., with State Department Special Envoy Jim Jeffrey announcing the majority will go to countries in the region that host hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees each. The deeper U.S. cuts have been to stabilization funding — the projects like rubble removal, de-mining, and restoration of services like running water that the U.S. has said are necessary to restore life to areas freed of ISIS and prevent the rise of a new terror group. Last August, the U.S. cut over $200 million in stabilization, and in this year’s budget proposal, the White House wanted to zero out any more funding. The U.S. is instead “looking for new sources of stability funds,” according to Amb. Jeffrey, after securing $325 million from coalition partners last summer, most of that from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But the needs on the ground are great, and it’s unclear where new stabilization funding may come from. What the U.S. has made clear with allies in Europe and the Middle East is that none of them will provide funding for areas controlled by the Assad regime or its supporters. They’re trying to use that as leverage over Russia and Assad to come back to U.N. talks about the country’s future, knowing that both parties are desperate not to foot the enormous bill to rebuild. So far, however, it hasn’t worked — with Russia, Iran, and Turkey engaging in their own talks. But that peace process is fragile. Turkey backs the rebel groups in Idlib, even those with ties to al Qaeda and other jihadists, and Assad, Russia, and Iran want to take back these last strongholds of opposition — with airstrikes and bombings flaring up in recent weeks. The State Department said yesterday the U.S. is “alarmed by the escalation of violence,” which continues “to destabilize the region, exacerbate the dire humanitarian situation, and cause dozens of civilian deaths and injuries — many of them children.” “The violence must end,” said spokesperson Morgan Ortagus, accusing Russia and the regime of “blatantly” targeting humanitarian groups like the White Helmets, the volunteer EMS responders who have gained international acclaim for their efforts to rescue Syrians from bombings and airstrikes but have also been allegedly attacked by a smear disinformation campaign by Russia. The head of the White Helmets was in Washington over the last week, meeting with lawmakers and officials at the White House, State Department, and U.S. Agency for International Development and asking for more support. Despite the larger cuts to Syria, the White Helmets received an additional $5 million in U.S. funding in March. Raed Saleh told ABC News the appointment of Ambassador Jeffrey last year has given the group confidence and they see the U.S. more engaged now, but when asked about Trump’s desire to withdraw the U.S. from Syria, militarily and financially, he said they’ll “continue to monitor the other developments.” Copyright © 2019, ABC Radio.

MADRID -- Hundreds of firefighters struggled Thursday to contain a wildfire in northeastern Spain that has spread over 5,500 hectares (13,590 acres) and forced the evacuation of 53 residents.

A Spanish military unit with 120 specialists joined local firefighters who had worked overnight to control the blaze that sent thick plumes of smoke over difficult, hilly terrain near the Ebro River.

Miquel Buch, the regional interior minister, said 20,000 hectares were under threat in what is the worst fire in the Catalonia region in two decades.

Buch said authorities suspect the cause of the outbreak was a deposit of improperly stored chicken manure at a farm in the village of Torre de l'Espanyol that high temperatures caused to combust.

Television images showed horses and sheep incinerated on a farm that had stood in the path of the fire.

Five roads were closed to traffic in the rural area which is about 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of Barcelona.

The fire comes amid a heat wave that is boosting temperatures across Europe.

Firefighters said that temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), low humidity, and high winds fanned the flames.",2019-06-27

Thousands of migrants like Castillo are crossing the border every day and turning themselves in to the Border Patrol. They're fleeing poverty and violence in Central America.

At the current pace, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen says, almost 100,000 migrants will cross the border this month — far exceeding last month's total. Nielsen traveled to Texas on Thursday and talked with local sheriffs about what she's calling a ""catastrophe"" at the Southern border.

""Our laws aren't keeping up with the migrant flows,"" Nielsen said earlier this week in Washington. ""And until they are fixed, the situation will only get worse and more heartbreaking.""

And that's at the heart of the current immigration debate. One side says these migrants deserve the chance to apply for asylum, while the other says we need to change our immigration laws to stop them from coming.

But these familiar positions don't tell us why the numbers are climbing so quickly. Conditions in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras haven't changed dramatically, nor have U.S. immigration laws.

So why are more migrants choosing to come now? NPR interviewed more than a dozen recent migrants and experts for this story. And we found three possible factors: the simple economics of cheaper human smuggling costs, the reach of social media and — ironically — the Trump administration's own immigration crackdown.

The business of human smuggling

It's not just easier for migrants to get into the U.S. with a child. In many cases, it's cheaper as well.

""If you traveled by yourself as a single male, today it would cost you almost $12,000,"" said Luis Argueta, an award-winning filmmaker based in Guatemala who has been documenting international migration since the 1970s. ""But if you have a child, it'll cost a lot less.""

For his next film, Argueta has been interviewing migrants, including a man who left Guatemala and crossed the border with his 13-year-old daughter in February. Argueta says the journey cost him less than $7,000 for both of them.

""So it's quite a bit of savings. There is a moral and personal cost, and he is not immune to that,"" Argueta told me. ""But on the other hand, he knows that his child will be able to have a better education.""

Smugglers charge the families less because they drop the families at the border and tell them to turn themselves in on the other side. But migrants traveling alone have to be smuggled across the border because they are more likely to be detained or immediately deported. And as smugglers cut the price for families, they get more customers.

'People are seeing that others are making it'

A second possible factor that's driving the surge in migration is social media.

Smugglers use social networks to market their services. And migrants can see that their own family members and friends have made it to the U.S, said Argueta.

""People are seeing that others are making it,"" said Argueta. ""Everybody has cell phones. Everybody has Facebook. You know you'll see pictures of people with vehicles, with jobs, with nice clothes.""

People think that he might be serious. So they have to do it now. It's now or never. - Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, George Mason University

That includes the Guatemalan man Argueta recently interviewed for his film.

""I have friends here in the U.S., and we talk on social media,"" the man told Argueta in Spanish. ""I asked what's it like here, and they said it's good. True, you have to borrow money to travel here. But it doesn't matter how big the debt is — you can pay it off once you arrive.""

Trump's immigration crackdown

There's a third possible factor at play here, and that is the Trump administration's own policies.

The administration has tried a variety of ways to deter these migrants — even separating parents and children at the border under its ""zero tolerance"" policy last year. But those efforts may have backfired by drawing so much attention to the crackdown at the border.

""This is very ironic,"" said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, who teaches border security and migration at George Mason University. She says migrants know that President Trump wants to keep them out.

""People think that he might be serious. So they have to do it now. It's now or never,"" Correa-Cabrera said.

That's another reason Castillo, the young mother from Honduras, decided to make the trip now.

""I watch the news, and, yes, that's our fear,"" she said. ""That the laws will change. And if you bring a child, they won't let you enter. It's better to come sooner. We sold what little we had in our country and hit the road.""

She also heard from relatives in the U.S. that it would be easier to enter the country if she brought a child. Migrant families are likely to be released from detention in the U.S. to wait for their day in immigration court.

So, like tens of thousands of other migrants, Castillo decided that the bigger risk would be staying home.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen is in Texas today. She's there to get a firsthand look at what she's calling a catastrophe at the southern border, a catastrophe that she says is caused by a flood of migrants from Central America. At the current pace, Nielsen says almost 100,000 migrants will cross the border this month, far exceeding last month's total. NPR's Joel Rose reports on why the numbers keep going up and up.

We found three possible factors - the simple economics of price cutting, the reach of social media and, ironically, the Trump administration's own immigration crackdown. First, the business of human smuggling.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken).

ROSE: Here's one migrant from Guatemala. He made it to a shelter in Tucson, Ariz., with his daughter. Not only can you get into the country if you bring your child, but he says it's cheaper, too.

LUIS ARGUETA: So it's quite a bit of savings.

ROSE: Luis Argueta is an award-winning filmmaker based in Guatemala who's been documenting international migration since the 1970s.

ARGUETA: If you travel by yourself as a single male today, it would cost you almost $12,000, but if you have a child, it'll cost you a lot less.

The administration has tried a bunch of ways to deter these migrants, even separating parents and children at the border under its zero tolerance policy last year. But those efforts may have backfired by drawing so much attention.

EN2892156,https://patriotpost.us/opinion/66600-three-cheers-for-refugee-reduction-2019-11-06,,"Right Opinion Three Cheers for Refugee Reduction

Over the weekend, President Donald Trump approved a new annual refugee cap of 18,000, the lowest since the U.S. program began in 1980. The reduction follows news that America took a pause last month and refused to admit any new refugees. On economic, public safety and national security grounds, this is a very good thing for the 325 million people already in our country. But you wouldn’t know it from the grim headlines and hysterical condemnations by globalist zealots and media sympathizers.

CNN International led the open borders funeral procession last week, with a report decrying, “No refugees will be resettled in the US in October, leaving hundreds in limbo around the world.” U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., hyperventilated that “Donald Trump is trying to destroy the very heart of this nation. I won’t let him.” Social justice group CARE bemoaned this “dark moment in our nation’s history.” Human Rights First complained that Trump’s proposal is “crippling the United States’ status as a global leader in refugee resettlement.”

Heaven forbid citizens in a sovereign nation have an effective say in who comes here, from where and how many. Is one refugee-less month in America such a catastrophe? Calm down, Chicken Littles. Get some perspective.

It is most certainly true that America has a legacy of embracing people from around the world fleeing persecution and war. After World War II, the U.S. helped lead efforts to assist 650,000 displaced Europeans who had fled in fear, were expelled and were victims of Nazi crimes and terror. Congress passed the 1948 Displaced Persons Act to accommodate them. Five years later, the Refugee Relief Act of 1953 aided refugees from Italy and East Germany escaping Communist regimes, adding another 250,000 refugees over four years. In the 1950s and 1960s, we welcomed Hungarians, Cubans and Czechoslovakians also escaping Communist oppression. In the 1970s, we opened our doors to an estimated 300,000 political refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. The Refugee Act of 1980 created the Office of Refugee Resettlement and office of U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs and raised the annual ceiling of admissions to 50,000.

Under Obama, that number soared to nearly 100,000 annually. The idea that we’ve abandoned our humanitarian leadership role because of this refugee resettlement reduction is ludicrous. Overall, since 1975, the U.S. has resettled more than 3 million refugees. Under Trump, the U.S. still accepted more refugees than any other country in both 2017 and 2018. On top of that, America forked over nearly $1.6 billion to support the U.N.‘s refugee resettlement campaign. Moreover, America remains the largest single country provider of humanitarian assistance worldwide. Total U.S. humanitarian assistance was more than $8 billion in fiscal year 2017, covering food, shelter, health care and access to clean water for millions.

That’s enough.

Past refugee admissions don’t lock America into those same levels now or in the future. America’s constitutional duty is to Americans first (“ourselves and our posterity”). The truth is that we’ve been generous to a ruinous, open borders fault. Last year, the Federation for American Immigration Reform tallied refugee resettlement costs to taxpayers at nearly $9 billion over five years.

In my adopted home state of Colorado, a new University of Colorado Boulder study acknowledged that refugees are often “trapped in chronic poverty” after resettlement subsidies dry up and are unable to lift themselves out of dependency on government aid such as public housing, Medicaid and food stamps. Federal statistics show that nearly half of all refugee households receive cash welfare. Chain migration perpetuates the cycle of poverty.

A tiny cabal of government contractors, mostly religious groups cloaking their profit-seeking in compassion and Scripture, perpetuates the refugee resettlement racket. Openly hostile to American sovereignty, these people spread their tax-subsidized syndicate’s wealth to a vast network of subcontractors, often tied to billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Foundations, which promote global governance and unfettered migration espoused by the United Nations, European Union and Vatican. These special interests have systematically blurred the lines between legitimate refugees seeking asylum from oppression and economic migrants from Central America clamoring for higher wages or better welfare benefits. They’re indifferent to the national security risks of absorbing large numbers of Muslims whose adherence to repressive sharia and religious jihad is utterly incompatible with our constitutional principles.

Mass migration champions have stretched the definition of refugee so thin that “climate change refugees” seeking relief from uninhabitable environments are now a phenomenon. Nuts. Doesn’t America have enough residents in need of shelter and support? If we let in millions of “climate change refugees,” where do Americans seek refuge when they render our climate uninhabitable?

Only a complete moratorium on immigration would give America the break it needs to regain control of our system. Trump’s refugee reduction is not an apocalypse. It’s a long overdue respite from the world’s wretched refuse that deserves cheers, not jeers.

Stephen Gluning, WFP representative and country director, said the Italian government’s contribution to the program would support families over three months, providing them with cash assistance in exchange for their participation in livelihood projects focused on fisheries and farming.

“The WFP is grateful to the government of Italy for their continued generous support to our recovery operations to address the food security and nutrition needs of communities affected by the Marawi crisis,” according to Gluning.







It will work in partnership with the Philippine government, through the Department of Agriculture, Department of Agrarian Reform and Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources to implement the project.

“As the rehabilitation of Marawi City continues, Italy stands with the Philippine government in its efforts to assist the people of Marawi,” Italian Ambassador Giorgio Guglielmino said in a statement.

The UN Joint Human Rights Office in the DRC* initiated an investigation following reports that as many as 890 people had been killed and thousands displaced as a result of clashes between the Banunu and Batende communities.

The investigation team was able to verify that at least 535 men, women and children were killed and 111 others injured in Yumbi town, Bongende village and Nkolo II village. In addition, almost 1,000 buildings, mostly houses as well as some churches, schools and health centres were destroyed or looted. The investigative team was unable to reach a fourth location, Camp Nbanzi, where attacks were also reported. The number of casualties is likely to be higher, as the bodies of some who died are believed to have been thrown into the Congo River. It was also not possible to confirm the number of persons still missing as an estimated 19,000 people were displaced by the violence, 16,000 of whom crossed the Congo River into the Republic of the Congo.

The investigation found that the attacks, which were triggered by a dispute over the burial of a Banunu customary chief, followed strikingly similar patterns and were characterized by extreme violence and speed, leaving little time for people to escape. They were led by Batende villagers equipped with firearms, including hunting rifles, machetes, bows and arrows, and gasoline, and targeted Banunu villagers. People were attacked in the streets, in their homes and as they tried to flee.

The report details horrors documented such as a two-year-old reportedly thrown into a septic tank, and a woman reportedly brutally raped after her three-year-old child was decapitated and her husband killed. In some cases, witnesses report that victims were asked if they were Banunu, before they were killed. Many were killed as they tried to cross the Congo River. Others were burnt alive in their homes, and some survivors had serious burn injuries. In some cases, the attackers mutilated the bodies of their victims, cutting off heads, limbs and genitals.

“The similarity in the way the attacks were carried out indicated prior consultation and organization,” the report states. “Certain chiefs of Batende-majority villages were cited by many sources as having taken part in the planning of the attacks.”

The investigation concluded that the crimes documented in Yumbi may amount to the crimes against humanity of murder, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as persecution.

The report stresses that the violence was facilitated by the absence of State action to prevent it, noting that “provincial authorities appear to have failed in their responsibility to protect the population.” In spite of clear signs of rising tensions and an increased risk of violence, no steps were taken to reinforce security ahead of the attacks.

The report warns of the risk of renewed violence.

“Tensions and resentment between the two communities, combined with rumours of reprisals, could give rise to new waves of violence at any time,” the report states “which could also flare up in other territories of Mai-Ndombe or Equateur.”

The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General in the DRC, Leila Zerrougui, called for urgent measures to restore the authority of the State in Yumbi territory, and to create conditions for the safe and voluntary return of those displaced.

“The neutral presence of State institutions, including the police, is important to maintain law and order and to prevent the risk of further violence,” Zerrougui said. This is particularly important in the run-up to national and provincial legislative elections, which were delayed due to the violence and are now due to take place in Yumbi territory on 31 March.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet stressed the importance of justice and accountability to establish the facts and hold those responsible accountable. She offered the support of the Office to ongoing judicial investigations into the violence.

“It is crucial to ensure that the perpetrators of these terrible crimes are punished and that the many women, children and men who were victims of this terrifying violence receive justice and support,” Bachelet said. “I also urge the Government to initiate a process of truth and reconciliation between the Banunu and Batende communities, which will be essential in addressing feelings of intercommunal conflict and preventing further violence.”

The two are homeless, he told CNN, but they've found family in each other and their midtown Memphis community. So when they reunited, naturally, it was nothing short of enchanting. In a video (below) from Memphis Animal Services, Bobo bounds into Rogers' arms, his tail wagging furiously. He can hardly contain his excitement when he's reunited with his owner, skittering around him with heaping licks of love. A missing friend Rogers woke up early in the morning Aug. 31 to find Bobo had disappeared. Friends made posters with the 1-year-old pitbull-labrador mix's sweet face to find him, the shelter wrote on Facebook. Two weeks later, the affable pup ended up at Memphis Animal Services. An employee recognized him and called Rogers' friend, who drove him to the shelter to reunite them. Cue the happy tears The shelter sent Bobo back with a year's supply of heartworm prevention medication, a bag of dog food, a harness, leash, collar and ID tag, so if he ever wanders off again, he can safely return to his owner, the shelter said. A local animal hospital will accept donations for Bobo's future care. Anthony Rogers told CNN affiliate WMC he rescued Bobo as a puppy. He called the one-year-old pitbull-labrador mix his ""lifesaver."" ""It means a lot to me,"" he said. ""He's a good guy, and I thank everybody for their time and for watching out for us.""",2019-09-18

EN2591213,https://syrianobserver.com/EN/news/50489/dozens-of-families-evacuated-from-khan-sheikhoun.html,,"As regime and Russia attacks on Idleb intensify, hundreds of thousands of families have been forced to seek safety near the Turkish border reports Alsouria Net.

The Syrian Civil Defense on its Twitter account has discussed the evacuation to less dangerous areas of dozens of families in Khan Sheikhoun in the southern Idleb countryside, which occurred during the heavy attacks that the area has been subjected to by war planes and barrel bombs. The Civil Defense said that, “Yes, it is migration, but to an unknown location,” adding that “nothing living remains in the city.”

The others parts of the “de-escalation zone” face the same fate, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights recording that 47 barrel bombs dropped on parts of Idleb, Hama and Lattakia since Wednesday-Thursday night.

The Observatory said that 29 barrel bombs had fallen on various parts of Idleb, including eight barrels on Alhbeit and six on Khan Sheikhoun and its outskirts and six on Kabbaneh.

Regime warplanes have carried out 21 airstrikes since that night, with six on the Kabbaneh front and four on Khan Sheikhoun and four on Alhbeit and three on Maarat Hurmah and two on Hesh and two on Jbala and its environs.

According to the Observatory, Russian warplanes also carried out a number of raids on areas in the village of al-Enkawi in Sahel al-Ghab in the northwestern Hama countryside, while regime forces, with intensified artillery and rocket shelling, struck areas on the Kabbaneh front in Jabel al-Akrud and Ltamenah and Kafr Zita in the northern Hama countryside.

On Wednesday, three civilians were killed and others were wounded in the latest bombardment by Assad’s forces in the western Aleppo countryside, hours after a massacre carried out in Jisr al-Shaghour in western Idleb that killed and wounded at least 25 people.

The “de-escalation zone” is inhabited by about four million civilians, including hundreds of thousands of those who were displaced from their cities and towns after the regime took control of them in the Damascus, Homs and Daraa countrysides.

The bombardments by the regime and its allies on the “de-escalation zones” has killed at least 135 civilians, and wounded more than 365 others since Apr. 25, 2019, according to the Syrian Civil Defense. It has also displaced hundreds of thousands to areas near the Turkish border.

The head of the High Negotiations Committee, Nasr al-Hariri, called on the Turkish guarantor on Tuesday to increase protections for civilians and to ensure the implementation of the Idleb agreement, saying that northwestern Syria could not fall to Assad’s authorities by way of force.

During his meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, Hariri discussed the severe military escalation in Idleb by Assad’s forces and their allies.

Hariri said that he discussed with the Minister, the regime’s violations of the ceasefire agreement as well as the efforts being made to stop the escalation. He stressed the need for civilians to be protected during the ongoing operations and for the Idleb agreement signed last year to be implemented and for humanitarian aid to enter, according to the Syrian Coalition’s media department.

With regards to the Turkish position around the escalation, the committee head said that he felt there was great Turkish concern for what is happening in Idleb, and said that the regime and Russia were taking terrorism as a pretext to target civilians and destroy infrastructure, hospitals and schools.

Hariri said during his meeting that the Syrian opposition was, “fighting all forms of terrorism, including the terrorism of Iranian militias,” and added that this, “cannot undermine the Syrian people or put areas under regime authority by force” and said that this violated relevant UN decisions and the Idleb agreement.

EN2521252,https://www.perhamfocus.com/news/4593086-county-ready-respond-when-disasters-take-place,,"West central Minnesota, and Otter Tail County in particular, has witnessed many tornado sightings and damage throughout the years.

A tornado in 2010 killed a resident northwest of Parkers Prairie and southeast of Henning, in the town of Almora.

listen live watch live

It was a century ago, in June 1919, when a deadly tornado struck Fergus Falls before the days of good weather forecasts and adequate warning sirens. That year 57 people lost their lives and close to 150 people were injured.

""Today we as county government have plans in place to protect county residents before, during and after disasters or emergencies,"" said County Emergency Management Director Patrick Waletzko during a morning gathering March 22 at the county museum in Fergus Falls.

County employees, under Waletzko's leadership, will coordinate with impacted local governments, interface with responding state and federal agencies, support affected homes, businesses and industries, providing information and guidance and secure resources to support short-term and long-term recovery efforts.

""We also can call in for additional help, including a chemical assessment team from Fargo,"" Waletzko said. ""We also could request County Sheriff Barry Fitzgibbons to coordinate with Gov. Tim Walz the dispatching of the National Guard to the severe hit areas here in Otter Tail County.""

That's one thing in common with the Fergus Falls tornado that struck in 1919. The National Guard came to Fergus Falls a century ago to help in the aftermath of this local disaster.

In 1919 telephone and telegraphic systems were destroyed in Fergus Falls. Today, businesses such as Verizon would bring in trailers equipped with communications and backup equipment.

In 1919 the Fergus Falls tornado left a tangled mess. Today, vehicles attached with winter plows would assist with getting debris hauled to temporary sorting sites such as at municipal airports.

Plans are in place to house people displaced from homes in 29 temporary shelters at schools, churches and other locations throughout Otter Tail County. The Red Cross would be able to offer assistance.

""We'll be ready when disaster strikes,"" Waletzko said.",2019-04-01

Acting on a tip-off, a patrol ship challenged a fishing boat near Saint Martin's, a small Bangladesh island in the Bay of Bengal, and found the Rohingya on board, coast guard Lieutenant Josel Rana said.

""We've found 58 refugees and detained two human traffickers on the boat,"" he told AFP.

About 740,000 Muslim minority Rohingya have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh since a brutal military crackdown in the Buddhist-majority nation began in August 2017.

Thousands of refugees attempt to flee the camps each year in pursuit of better opportunities in countries such as Malaysia and Thailand.

So far this year, law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh have rescued over 400 Rohingya refugees from coastal villages as they were waiting to board boats bound for Malaysia.

But this is the first time in 2019 that Rohingya refugees were rescued at sea, raising concerns that the situation in Bangladesh's overcrowded camps -- home to nearly one million -- is worsening.

""Such incidents will continue as desperation among the refugees is on the rise,"" said Emdadul Haq, a professor at the private North South University in Dhaka. Rana said most of the refugees picked up by the coast guard were from the Kutupalong camp -- the largest refugee settlement in the world.

Most attempt the journey before March, when the sea is calm before the monsoon season sets in, but experts say traffickers are now convincing the refugees to attempt the trip even in rough waters.

The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has said the vulnerability of Rohingya to trafficking has increased enormously as livelihoods, support networks, and other fundamental systems are disrupted.

A report in the state-run Peoples Daily on Sunday revealed that the incident took place at the Lijiagou mine in the city of Shenmu in northwest China at around 4.30 pm (0830 GMT) on Saturday. The report claimed that the roof of the mine, which is owned by Baiji Mining Co Ltd, collapsed when 87 people were underground. Authorities quoted in the report confirmed that 66 miners were rescued from the mine, while 21 were trapped underground. Initially, local reports claimed that 19 of the 21 trapped miners were found dead after the roof caved in. However, emergency operations to rescue two missing miners continued for hours after the accident at the end of which, their bodies were found. According to a report in the official news agency Xinhua, city government officials confirmed on Sunday that 66 miners were safely evacuated. The report also stated that the cause of the accident at the site is under investigation. It noted that authorities in Shanxi province would carry out inspections at high-risk coal mines in the region after Saturday's accident became the deadliest reported so far this year in Chinas coal industry. Poor safety record in focus Deadly mining accidents in China have become common in recent years, despite the government's efforts to improve safety. The frequent accidents and increasing mining casualties in the country has earned China's mining industry the status of being one the deadliest in the world. Saturday's accident comes merely weeks after seven workers were killed and three others were injured in an underground transport accident at the Fengchun coal mine under the Chongqing Energy Group in Chinas southwestern city of Chongqing. The accident, which occurred on December 17, 2018, took place when the connecting segment of a mining skip broke, which led it to slide down the inclined shaft. Before that, an accident at a coal mine in Yuncheng county of Shangdong province left eight miners dead in October last year. Authorities said at the time that pressure inside the Yuncheng coal mine caused rocks to rip apart and break, killing workers inside. Security checks at 41 coal mines in the Shandong province were ordered soon after the accident. In June 2018, 11 workers were killed and nine others were injured in a powerful explosion at an iron mine in China's northeast Liaoning province. Before that, in May of last year, a methane gas explosion inside a coal mine in the country's central Hunan province killed at least five workers. According to authorities in China, which is the worlds largest producer of coal, the number of deaths from mining accidents have reduced in recent years, but the number of accidents have continued to rise. Last year, in a bid to improve safety conditions, Chinas coal mine safety watchdog launched inspections of mines across the country. The inspections are expected to continue until June this year. Earlier this week, the state-backed Shanghai Securities News (SSN) reported that some mining firms in major coal hubs in Shandong and Henan provinces, along with some in parts of northeastern China have received notices from the National Coal Mine Safety Administration. The notices reportedly ordered the mines to halt operations for inspections.",2019-01-14

New Delhi: Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Friday and appealed for release of funds immediately to take up relief work in the flood- and rain-ravaged state.

Responding to his appeal, the prime minister assured him about sending Central study team soon to assess the damage due to the flood, the chief minister said in the national capital after the meeting.

""The state is hit by a calamity that has not taken place in the last 108 years. Fifteen days ago, there was drought situation, but today dams are full and because of excess water released from Maharashtra there is damage caused... We have brought it to the notice of the prime minister,"" Yediyurappa said.

The Karnataka chief minister said the prime minister ""understood every thing"" and soon he will be sending a team for assessment.

""We have asked for release of funds as immediate relief. He (prime minister) said, he will discuss and let us know. I'm confident that he is in the know of the situation in the state as he has already gathered the information. Let's wait and see,"" he added.

Recently, Yediyurappa had requested the Centre to release Rs 3,000 crore as interim relief immediately to take up rehabilitation work.

Yediyurappa also met Railways Minister Piyush Goyal and Civil Aviation, Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.

The chief minister was accompanied by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi.

Joshi later tweeted:

Hitting out at the BJP-led Central government over the ""delay"" in announcing relief, despite Union home minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman personally assessing the situation, the Opposition parties-both Congress and JD(S) had demanded immediate release of Rs 5,000 crore as interim relief.

Asked if there was any assurance from the prime minister on granting Rs 3,000 crore as immediate relief, Yediyurappa merely said: ""According to an estimate, the loss is over Rs 40,000 crore.""

""They include damaged) houses, roads, and bridges. We have to find solutions to all these things. We have informed the prime minister about all these things,"" he added.

According to a release from the Chief Minister's Office, during the 45-minute meeting, Yediyurappa appraised Modi about the grave situation of the flood-hit areas in the state and explained that the losses suffered due to floods was unseen before, and more funds are required to take up relief measures and rebuild the lives of the victims.

Chief Secretary to Government TM Vijay Bhaskar, Additional Chief Secretary to Chief Minister P Ravikumar were present at the meeting, it added.

The death toll in flood and rain ravaged Karnataka has reached 62 till Thursday night, while 14 people are still classified as missing, and nearly seven lakh people have been evacuated till date.

As many as 943 relief camps are operational, where clean drinking water, food and other relief materials are being provided to 3,57,243 people housed in them.

Americans may too easily forget, in the midst of a biological plague, that assorted “ordinary” geopolitical threats have not thereby gone away. In this regard, multiple risks of nuclear war with several adversarial nations have actually been growing. Here, too, grievously fearful developments are largely attributable to an incompetent and indifferent American president.

Prima facie, the prognoses are plain. Going forward with Donald J. Trump, the United States could only anticipate the utterly worst forms of catastrophic convergence. Without hyperbole, should this president somehow remain in office, America’s plausible future could include variously intersecting and steadily escalating existential harms.

It’s time for recognizing particularities. In narrow geostrategic terms, North Korea and Iran represent the most obvious and compelling nuclear threats. This assessment is credible even though Iran is not yet operationally nuclear.[1] Why? It is because Iran is still capable of fighting a massive conventional conflict against America’s principal Middle Eastern ally.

In brief, Tehran could at some point prod the United States to consider using some of its extant nuclear forces on behalf of Israel.

There is more. Certain Sunni Arab states worried about an impending “Persian bomb” could also seek to obtain a countervailing nuclear capacity for themselves.[2] In this connection, Egypt and Saudi Arabia come most immediately to mind.

What happens next? What particular intersections or synergies might arise here involving Iran and Israel? And what might be the concurrent effects of “plague” (Covid19 pandemic) upon all of the pertinent “players?”

In essence, however the plausible conflict scenarios might be configured, all pertinent prospects are unprecedented and all portend unique outcomes that are sui generis.

Looking ahead, US policy attention should also be directed toward ongoing nuclear developments in Russia and China. As we are very clearly in the midst of a second Cold War, or “Cold War II,” these ongoing Russian and Chinese developments provide a background for other nuclear developments underway in Pyongyang and Tehran. “Cold War II,”[3] recently underscored by the growing scandal of Russian bounties to the Taliban for killing US forces in Afghanistan, represents the system within which virtually all contemporary world politics should now be categorized and assessed.[4]

In brief, the current Great Powers’ disposition to war, however it might be ascertained, isrelevant analytic background for still-wider nuclear interactions.

Planning ahead, what explanatory theories and scenarios could best guide the Trump administration in its many-sided interactions with North Korea, Iran, China and Russia? Before answering this basic question with any adequate and clarifying specificity, a “correct” answer – any correct answer – must depend upon one single overarching assumption. This is the inherently problematic expectation of adversarial rationality.

It now follows, among other things, that a primary “order of business” for those American strategic analysts and planners focused on this most urgent set of security problems will be reaching informed judgments about each determinable adversary’s ordering of preferences. By definition, only those particular adversaries who would value national survival more highly than any other preference or combination of preferences would be acting rationally.

For scholars and policy-makers, some further basic questions must now be considered. First, what are the operational meanings of relevant terminologies and/or vocabularies? Accordingly, in the formal study of international relations and military strategy, decisional irrationality never means the same thing as madness. Nonetheless, certain residual warnings about madness should still warrant very serious US policy consideration. This is because both “ordinary” irrationality and full-scale madness could exert more-or-less comparable effects upon any examined country’s national security decision-making processes.

Again, nothing here for the intellectually faint-hearted.

Sometime, for the United States, understanding and anticipating these ascertainable effects could display existential importance. In all such prospective considerations, words would matter a great deal. In normal strategic parlance, “irrationality” identifies a decisional foundation wherein national self-preservation is not summa, not the very highest and ultimate preference.

A prospectively irrational decision-maker in Pyongyang, Tehran or elsewhere need not be determinably “mad” in order to become troubling for policy analysis by aptly designated leaders in Washington. Such an adversary needs “only” to be more conspicuously concerned about certain discernible preferences or values than about its own collective self-preservation. One example would be preferences expressed for certain feasible outcomes other than national survival. Normally, any such behavior would be unexpected and counter-intuitive, but it would still not be unprecedented or inconceivable. Moreover, identifying the specific criteria or correlates of any such considered survival imperatives could prove irremediably subjective and/or simply indecipherable.

Whether an examined American adversary were sometime deemed irrational or “mad,” US military planners would have to input a generally similar decisional calculation. An analytic premise here would be that the particular adversary “in play” might not be suitably deterred from launching a military attack by any American threats of retaliatory destruction, even where such threats would be fully credible and presumptively massive. Any such failure of US military deterrence could include conventional and nuclear retaliatory threats.

In fashioning America’s nuclear strategy vis-à-vis nuclear and not-yet-nuclear adversaries,[5] US military planners must include a mechanism to determine whether a designated adversary (e.g., North Korea or Iran) will more likely be rational or irrational. Operationally, this means ascertaining whether the identifiably relevant foe will value its collective survival (whether as a sovereign state or an organized terror group) more highly than any other preference or combination of preferences. Always, this early judgment must be based upon defensibly sound analytic principles.

In principle, at least, it should never be affected in any tangible way by what particular analysts might themselves simply “want to believe.”[6]

A corollary US obligation, depending in large part upon this prior judgment concerning enemy rationality, will expect strategic planners to assess whether a properly nuanced posture of “pretended irrationality” could purposefully enhance America’s nuclear deterrence posture. On several occasions, it should be recalled here, President Donald Trump had openly praised at least the underlying premises of such an eccentric posture. Was such presidential praise intellectually warranted and/or properly justified?

Ever?

It depends. US enemies include both state and sub-state foes, whether considered singly or in various assorted forms of collaboration. Such forms could be “hybridized” in different ways between state and sub-state adversaries.[7] In dealing with Washington, each recognizable class of enemies could sometime choose to feign irrationality.

In principle, this could represent a potentially clever strategy to “get a jump” on the United States in any expected or already-ongoing competition for “escalation dominance.”[8] Naturally, any such calculated pretense could also fail, perhaps calamitously. Cautionary strategic behavior based on serious conceptual thinking should always be the presidential “order of the day.”[9]

There is something else. On occasion, these same enemies could “decide,” whether consciously or unwittingly, to actually be irrational.[10] In any such innately bewildering circumstances, it would then become incumbent upon American strategic planners to capably assess which basic form of irrationality – pretended or authentic – is actually underway. Thereafter, these planners would need to respond with a dialectically orchestrated and optimally counterpoised set of all possible reactions.

Once again, in purely intellectual terms, this would represent an uncommonly “tall order.”

There is more. In this context, the term “dialectically” (drawn originally from ancient Greek thought, especially Plato’s dialogues) is used with very precise meanings. This is done in order to signify a continuous or ongoing question-and-answer format of relevant strategic reasoning.

By definition, any instance of enemy irrationality would value certain specific preferences (e.g., presumed religious obligations or personal and/or regime safety) more highly than collective survival. For America, the grievously threatening prospect of facing some genuinely irrational nuclear adversary is prospectively most worrisome with regard to North Korea and at least possibly, in a now rapidly closing future, Iran.[11] Apropos of all such more-or-less credible apprehensions, it is unlikely that they could ever be meaningfully reduced by way of formal treaties or law-based agreements.[12]

Here it would be well worth remembering seventeenth-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes’ classic warning in Leviathan: “Covenants, without the sword, are but words….”[13] If this traditional problem of global anarchy were not daunting enough for American strategists and decision-makers, it is further complicated by the largely unforeseeable effects of worldwide pandemic and, perhaps correspondingly, the effects of any consequent chaos.

Chaos is not the same as anarchy. Chaos is much “more than” anarchy. We have lived with anarchy or absence of central government in modern world politics since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648,[14] but we have yet to descend into any genuine worldwide chaos.[15]

How should the United States proceed? At some point, at least in principle, the very best option could seem to be some sort of preemption; that is, a defensive non-nuclear first-strike directed against situationally appropriate North Korean or Iranian hard targets. In actuality, however, it is already very late for launching an operationally cost-effective preemption against North Korea, and – even if it could be properly defended in law as “anticipatory self-defense”[16] – any such action would likely come at a much-too-substantial human and political cost.

In specific regard to any current and potentially protracted US-Iran enmity, the American side must consider how its nuclear weapons could best be leveraged against that adversarial state in virtually any war scenario. A rational answer here could never include any operational use of such weapons. The only pertinent questions for US planners, therefore, should concern the calculable extent to which an asymmetrical US threat of nuclear escalation could sometime be made sufficiently and aptly credible.[17]

Once again, by definition, as long as Iran should remain non-nuclear, any US nuclear threat would necessarily be asymmetrical.

By applying all available standards of ordinary reason and logic (there are, after all, no usable historical points of reference in such unprecedented situations), Washington could most suitably determine that certain nuclear threats against Iran would serve American security interests only when Iranian military capacities, though still non-nuclear, were convincingly overwhelming. Any such daunting scenario, though difficult to imagine ex nihilo, might nonetheless be conceivable. This “strategic dialectic” holds most convincingly if Tehran were willing to escalate (a) to massive direct conventional attacks upon American territories or populations, and/or (b) to the significant use of biological warfare capabilities.

In any matter of prospective biological warfare, it is worth noting that we are currently in the midst of a naturally-occurring biological “assault,” and that even in the complete absence of any specific adversarial animus or intent, the injurious consequences are already at the outer limits of tolerability and sustainability.

Inter alia, all this should now imply a primary obligation for the United States (c) to focus continuously on incremental enhancements to its implicit nuclear deterrence posture; and (d) to develop a wide and nuanced range of plausible nuclear retaliatory options. The specific rationale of (d) (above), is the counter-intuitive understanding that credibility of nuclear threats could sometime vary inversely with perceived levels of destructiveness. In certain foreseeable circumstances, this means that the successful nuclear deterrence of Iran could depend upon nuclear weapons that are deemed sufficiently low-yield or small.

Sometimes, in fashioning a national nuclear deterrence posture, counter-intuitive strategic insight is most correctly “on the mark,” and therefore most indispensable. This is likely one of these “multi-layered” times.

There is more. Washington should continue to bear in mind that any US nuclear posture must focus on prevention rather than punishment. In any and all identifiable circumstances, using a portion of its available nuclear forces for vengeance rather than deterrence would miss the proverbial point; that is, to fully optimize US national security. Any American nuclear weapons use that were based on narrowly corrosive notions of revenge, and even if only as a residual or default option, would be irrational.

These are all complex intellectual issues, not simply political ones. America’s many-sided nuclear deterrent must be backed up by recognizably robust systems of active defense (BMD), especially if there should arise any determinable reason to fear an irrationalnuclear adversary. Although it is already well-known that no system of active defense can ever be entirely “leak-proof,” there is still good reason to suppose that certain BMD deployments could help safeguard both US civilian populations (soft targets) and American nuclear retaliatory forces (hard targets).[18] This means that technologically advanced anti-missile systems must remain indefinitely as a steadily-modernizing component of this country’s nuclear deterrence posture. Among other elements of permissible self-defense, this suggests continuously expanding emphases on laser-based weapon systems.

While it may at first sound annoyingly obvious, it must still be remembered that in the bewildering nuclear age, seemingly defensive strategies could sometime be viewed by uneasy adversaries as offensive. This is because the secure foundation of any system of nuclear deterrence must be some reasonable presumption of mutual vulnerability.“Everything is very simple in war,” says Clausewitz, in On War, “but the simplest thing is still difficult.”

To progress in its most vital national security obligations, American military planners must more expressly identify the prioritized goals of this country’s nuclear deterrence posture. Before any rationaladversary could be suitably deterred by an American nuclear deterrent, that enemy would first need to believe that Washington had capably maintained the capacity to launch appropriate nuclear reprisals for relevant forms of aggression (nuclear and perhaps biological/non-nuclear), and also the will[19] to undertake such uniquely consequential firings.

About the first belief criterion, it would almost certainly lie beyond any “reasonable doubt.”

Well beyond.

The second expectation, however, could sometime prove problematic and thus more-or-less “fatally” undermine US nuclear deterrence. In assorted ways that are not yet clearly understood, the necessary national will could be impacted by pandemic-related or even pandemic-created factors.[20] Significantly, too, there would be certain hard-to-foresee interactions or synergies taking place between US policy decisions and those of pertinent American adversaries.

In more perplexing matters involving an expectedly irrationalnuclear enemy,[21] successful US deterrence would need to be based upon distinctly credible threats to enemy values other than national survival. Here, too, the actual prospect of enemy irrationality could be related to pandemic factors. In the most extreme cases, disease could actually play a tangible and determinative role in producing an enemy’s decisional irrationality.

More typically, America will also need to demonstrate the continuously substantial invulnerability of its nuclear retaliatory forces to enemy first strike aggressions. More precisely, it will remain in America’s long-term survival interests to continue to emphasize its variegated submarine-basing nuclear options.[22] Otherwise, as is plainly reasonable to contemplate, America’s land-based strategic nuclear forces could potentially present to a strongly-determined existential enemy (e.g., North Korea) as “too-vulnerable.”

For the moment, this is not a significantly serious concern, though Washington will want to stay focused on any still-planned deployment of submarines by its Israeli ally in the Middle East. The general point of such a secondary focus would be on strengthening Israeli nuclear deterrence, which – in one way or another – would simultaneously be to the overall strategic benefit of the United States.[23] Israel’s own nuclear deterrence could be affected by assorted pandemic-related variables, including some with serious reciprocal consequences for the United States.

There is more. Increasingly, America will have to rely on a broadly multi-faceted doctrine of nuclear deterrence.[24] In turn, like its already-nuclear Israeli ally,[25] specific elements of this “simple but difficult” doctrine could sometime need to be rendered less “ambiguous.” This complex and finely nuanced modification will require an even more determined focus on prospectively rational and irrational enemies, including both national and sub-national foes.

To deal most successfully with its presumptively irrational or non-rational enemies, and whether or not impacted by pandemic factors, this country will need to compose a continuously-updating strategic “playbook.” Here, it could become necessary for Washington to consider, at least on occasion, policies of feigned irrationality. In such analytically-challenging cases, it would be important for the American president not to react in an ad hoc or “seat-of-the-pants” fashion to each and every new strategic development or eruption, but instead to derive or extrapolate all specific policy reactions from a suitably pre-fashionedand comprehensive strategic nuclear doctrine.

Without such a thoughtful doctrine as guide, pretended irrationality could quickly become a “double-edged sword,” effectively bringing more rather than less security harms to the United States.[26]

There is one penultimate but still critical observation. It is improbable, but not inconceivable, that certain of America’s principal enemies would be neither rational nor irrational, but mad. While irrational decision-makers would already pose special problems for US nuclear deterrence – by definition, because these decision-makers would not value collective survival more highly than any other preference or combination of preferences – they might still be rendered susceptible to various alternate forms of deterrence.

Here, resembling rational decision-makers, they could still maintain a fixed, determinable and “transitive” hierarchy of preferences. This means, at least in principle, that “merely” irrational enemies could still sometimes be successfully deterred. This is an observation well worth further analytic study.

Mad or “crazy” adversaries, on the other hand, would have no such calculable hierarchy of preferences, and would therefore not be subject to any strategy of American nuclear deterrence. Although it would likely be far worse for the United States to have to face a mad nuclear enemy than a “merely” irrational one, Washington would have no foreseeable choice in this matter. This country, like it or not, will need to maintain, perhaps indefinitely, a “three track” system of nuclear deterrence and defense, one track for each of its still-identifiable adversaries that are presumptively (1) rational (2) irrational or (3) mad.

Again, this will not be task for the narrowly political or intellectually averse US decision-maker.

Further, for the most notably unpredictable third track, special plans will be needed for undertaking certain potentially indispensable preemptions, and, simultaneously, for corresponding/overlapping efforts atballistic missile defense.

Naturally, there could be no assurances that any one “track” would always present exclusively of the others. This means, portentously, that American decision-makers could sometimes have to face deeply intersecting or interpenetrating tracks, and also that these complicated simultaneities could be synergistic.[27]

There is one final observation to be noted. Even if America’s military planners could reassuringly assume that enemy leaderships were fully rational, this would say nothing about the accuracy of the actual information used by these foes in making their particular calculations. Always, it must never be forgotten, rationality refers only to the intention of maximizing certain designated preference or values. It says nothing about whether the information being used is either correct or incorrect.

There is more. In this extraordinary time of global “plague,” any such intention – American or adversarial – could have pandemic-related determinants. At a minimum, this fact should be regarded as sobering to America’s national security decision-makers. For these officials, this will be a moment in history to disavow any inclinations to hubris, to excessive pride, and to accept, instead, an abundance of prudential caution.

America is not automatically made safer by having rational adversaries. Even fully rational enemy leaderships could commit serious errors in calculation that lead them toward a nuclear confrontation or to a nuclear/biological war. There are also certain related command and control issues that could impel a perfectly rational adversary or combination of rational adversaries (both state and sub-state) to embark upon various risky nuclear behaviors. It follows that even the most pleasingly “optimistic” assessments of enemy leadership decision-making could never reliably preclude authentically catastrophic outcomes.[28]

For the United States, understanding that no scientifically accurate judgments of probability can ever be made about unique events (by definition, any nuclear exchange would be sui generis, or precisely such a unique event), the very best lessons for America’s president should favor a determined decisional prudence and a deliberate posture of humility. Of special interest, in this connection, is the always erroneous presumption that having greater nuclear military power than an adversary is automatically an assurance of future bargaining or diplomatic success. When Donald Trump said on several occasions that he and Kim Jung Un both have a “nuclear button,” but that his button “is bigger,” the American president overestimated the US advantages of any such presumptive asymmetry.

Wholly overestimated.

Why? Because the tangible amount of deliverable nuclear firepower required for deterrence is necessarily much less than what could ever be required for “victory.”[29] This is now a time for displaying nuanced and purposeful counter-intuitive wisdom in Washington, and not for more clichéd presidential thinking or further rancorous barrages of some stunningly empty witticism.

For Washington, especially for this president, operating in the largely-unpracticed nuclear age, ancient Greek tragedy warnings about excessive leadership pride are not only still relevant, they are also palpably and irrefutably more important than ever before.

For the United States, these classical commentaries concerning hubris, left unheeded, could bring forth once unimaginable spasms of “retribution.”[30] The Greek tragedians, after all, were not yet called upon to reason about nuclear decision-making. None of this culminating suggestion is meant to build gratuitously upon America’s most manifestly reasonable fears or apprehensions, but only to remind everyone involved that competent national security planning must remain a bewilderingly complex struggle of “mind over mind.”[31]

Always, these remain fundamentally intellectual problems,[32] challenges requiring meticulous analytic preparation[33] rather than just a particular “attitude.”[34] Above all, such planning ought never become just another calculable contest of “mind over matter;”[35] that is, never just a vainly reassuring inventory of comparative weaponization or some presumptively superior “order of battle.” Unless this rudimentary point is more completely understood by senior US strategic policymakers and by the president of the United States – and until these same policymakers can begin to see the utterly overriding wisdom of expanded global cooperation and human “oneness”[36] – America can never make itself sufficiently secure from nuclear or biological war.

Never.[37]

In his 1927 preface to Oxford Poetry, W.H. Auden wrote: “All genuine poetry is in a sense the formation of private spheres out of public chaos….” Looking ahead with an appropriately avant-garde orientation, American strategists must essentially seek to carve out livable national spheres from a steadily expanding global chaos. Ultimately, of course, following Nietzsche, they must understand that such chaos originally lies within each individual human being, but – at least for the moment of their present strategic deliberations – they must focus upon collective survival in a true Hobbesian “state of nature.”

With the predictable spread of nuclear weapons to additional states (and, perhaps, to sub-national terror groups), the historical conditions of nature bequeathed at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 could soon come to resemble the primordial barbarism of William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. Long before Golding, the seventeenth-century English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had warned insightfully in Leviathan (Chapter XIII) that in any such circumstances of human disorder here there exists “continual fear, and danger of violent death, the “life of Man” must inevitably be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” To best plan its strategic future, America will first need to understand a plausible world system transformation from anarchy to chaos, and to accommodate this drastic pandemic-hastened transformation with some more authentically imaginative thinking.

In such crucial matters, recalling Italian film director Federico Fellini,

“The visionary is the only realist.”

In the final analysis, as Nietzsche himself acknowledges, chaos is an intra-personal condition before it can ever become an international one.[38] This means that the core problem of chaos must be “solved” at the behavioral level before it can be solved in any larger arenas of nuclear strategy, international relations or international law. On this irremediably central understanding, one now made substantially more urgent by global pandemic, it would be worthwhile for engaged strategists to heed and assess the thoughtful words of Trappist monk and 20th-century thinker Thomas Merton, not because they could have any immediate “practical” value, but because they can serve as a long-term reminder of what is ultimately being asked of us all:

“When there is a deep, simple, all-embracing love of man, of the created world of living and inanimate things, then there will be respect for life, for freedom, for truth, for justice, and there will be humble love of God. But where there is no love of man, no love of life, then make all the laws you want, all the edicts and treaties, issue all the anathemas, set up all the safeguards and inspections, fill the air with spying satellites, and hang cameras on the moon. As long as you see your fellow man as a being essentially to be feared, mistrusted, hated and destroyed, there cannot be peace on earth.”[39]

Summing up, US foreign policy initiatives concerning nuclear war avoidance must shift from traditional notions of “realism” to more enduring ideas of “planetization.”[40] Though seemingly utopian, these ideas are ultimately more realistic than any global continuance of Thomas Hobbes’ “state of nature.” For the time being, pertinent American policies will still have to be founded upon intellectually supportable principles of nuclear deterrence and corresponding elements of “preparation,” but such foundations should not be expected to last indefinitely. It follows that keeping the United States safely distant from nuclear conflagration will require an American leadership that can navigate all current and foreseeable risks – including some that are pandemic-related – and also plan competently for the problematic future.

In the end, as illustrated by both the more-or-less predictable effects of a nuclear war[41] and long-established effects of “plague,” we humans are all evident creatures of biology and all of us mustfinally recognize each other in this commonality. Moreover, this is a primal commonality, a determinative “oneness” worth adapting to all of America’s national security policies. Such structural interdependence underscores our interpenetrating existential vulnerabilities as individual human beings and our leaders’ corollary obligation to place the common good above any narrowly personal interests.[42]

The atom and the virus now pose a lethal convergence for the United States. To render this perilous simultaneity more manageable and tolerable will require an American leadership with suitably intellectual moorings and inclinations. Failing to meet this indispensable requirement would compel a once-promising nation to become hardened to a terrible and irremediable truth.

Then, recalling Albert Camus’ The Plague, we would need to get hardened “to silence.”

[4] In late June 2019, Russia announced that current US policies concerning bilateral nuclear treaty termination and also then-prospective US anti-missile deployments in eastern Europe could threaten “another Cuban missile crisis.” This suggests that Russia remains important in military nuclear terms not only for its obvious shaping of “Cold War II” context, but also (once again) as a direct and increasingly immediate nuclear threat to the United States.

[5] For a very recent analysis of deterring not-yet-nuclear adversaries in the case of Israel, see article co-authored by Professor Louis René Beres and (former Israeli Ambassador ) Zalman Shoval at the Modern War Institute, West Point (Pentagon): https://mwi.usma.edu/creating-seamless-strategic-deterrent-israel-case-study/

[6] Recall here the classic statement of Julius Caesar: “Men as a rule believe what they want to believe.” See: Caesar’s Gallic War, Book III, Chapter 18.

[7] This “hybrid” concept could also be applied to various pertinent ad hoc bilateral state collaborations against US strategic interests. For example, during June 2019, Russia and China collaborated to block an American initiative aimed at halting fuel deliveries to North Korea. The US-led cap on North Korea’s fuel imports had been intended to sanction any continuing North Korean nuclearization. Prima facie, of course, this narrowly visceral plan was entirely futile.

[9]The seventeenth-century French philosopher Blaise Pascal remarks prophetically in Pensées: “All our dignity consists in thought….It is upon this that we must depend…Let us labor then to think well: this is the foundation of morality.” Similar reasoning characterizes the writings of Baruch Spinoza, Pascal’s 17th-century contemporary. In Book II of his Ethics Spinoza considers the human mind, or the intellectual attributes, and – drawing further upon René Descartes – strives to define an essential theory of learning and knowledge.

[10] In his own work, Sigmund Freud sought to “excavate” deeper meanings concerning irrational human behavior. Always, he was a modern-day philosophe, a proud child of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, one who discovered profound analytic and therapeutic advantages in exploring sometimes-arcane literary paths to psychological knowledge. Freud maintained an extensive personal collection of antiquities which suggested certain penetrating psychological insights to him. Some of his pertinent collection was placed directly on his work desk; reportedly, he would often touch and turn the artifacts while deeply engaged in some challenging thought.

[13] Regarding “covenants,” US decision-makers should nonetheless be continually attentive to relevant considerations of law as well as strategy. More particularly, under authoritative law, states must judge every use of force twice: once with regard to the underlying right to wage war (jus ad bellum) and once with regard to the means used in conducting an actual war (jus in bello). Following the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 and the United Nations Charter (1945), there remains no defensible legal right to waging an aggressive war. However, the long-standing customary right of post-attack self-defense does remain codified at Article 51 of the UN Charter. Similarly subject to conformance, inter alia, with jus in bello criteria, certain instances of humanitarian intervention and collective security operations may also be consistent with jus ad bellum standards. The law of war, the rules of jus in bello, comprise: (1) laws on weapons; (2) laws on warfare; and (3) humanitarian rules. Codified primarily at the Hague and Geneva Conventions, these rules attempt to bring discrimination, proportionality and military necessity into all belligerent calculations.

[14]International law remains a “vigilante” or “Westphalian” system. See: Treaty of Peace of Munster, Oct. 1648, 1 Consol. T.S. 271; and Treaty of Peace of Osnabruck, Oct. 1648, 1., Consol. T.S. 119, Together, these two treaties comprise the Peace of Westphalia.

[15] Though composed in the seventeenth century, Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan may still offer us a prophetic vision of this prospective condition in modern world politics. During chaos, which is a “time of War,” says the English philosopher in Chapter XIII (“Of the Natural Condition of Mankind, as concerning their Felicity, and Misery.”): “… every man is Enemy to every man… and where the life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” Still, at the actual time of writing Leviathan, Hobbes believed that the condition of “nature” in world politics was less chaotic than that same condition extant among individual human beings. This was because of what he had called the “dreadful equality” of individual men in nature concerning the ability to kill others. This once-relevant differentiation has effectively disappeared with the continuing manufacture and spread of nuclear weapons, a spread soon apt to be exacerbated by an already-nuclear North Korea, by a not-yet-nuclear Iran and by the largely unpredictable effects of an ongoing disease pandemic.

[17]In regard to such questions, US strategic thinkers must inquire whether accepting a visible posture of limited nuclear war would merely exacerbate enemy nuclear intentions or whether it could actually enhance this country’s overall nuclear deterrence. Such questions have been raised by this author for many years, but usually in more explicit reference to broadly theoretical or generic nuclear threats. See, for example, Louis René Beres, The Management of World Power: A Theoretical Analysis (1972); Louis René Beres, Terrorism and Global Security: The Nuclear Threat (1979; second edition, 1987); Louis René Beres, Apocalypse: Nuclear Catastrophe in World Politics (1980); Louis René Beres, Mimicking Sisyphus: America’s Countervailing Nuclear Strategy (1983); Louis René Beres, Reason and Realpolitik: US Foreign Policy and World Order (1984); Louis René Beres, Security or Armageddon: Israel’s Nuclear Strategy (1986); and Louis René Beres, Surviving Amid Chaos: Israel’s Nuclear Strategy (2016).

[19] The modern philosophy origins of the term “will” lie in the writings of Arthur Schopenhauer, especially The World as Will and Idea (1818). For his own inspiration, Schopenhauer drew freely upon Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Later, Nietzsche drew just as freely and perhaps even more importantly upon Schopenhauer. Goethe was also a core intellectual source for Spanish existentialist Jose Ortega y’Gasset, author of the singularly prophetic work, The Revolt of the Masses (Le Rebelion de las Masas (1930). See, accordingly, Ortega’s very grand essay, “In Search of Goethe from Within” (1932), written for Die Neue Rundschau of Berlin on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe’s death. It is reprinted in Ortega’s anthology, The Dehumanization of Art (1948), and is available from Princeton University Press (1968).

[20] A prospectively positive impact, however, could center on improved opportunities for world-wide cooperation. See, on this hopeful point, by this author,. Louis René Beres, https://www.21global.ucsb.edu/global-e/march-2020/virulent-pathogens-and-global-solidarity-unseen-benefits-covid-19

[26] This brings to mind the closing query of Agamemnon in The Oresteia by Aeschylus: “Where will it end? When will it all be lulled back into sleep, and cease, the bloody hatreds, the destruction”?

[28] In this connection, expressions of decisional error (including mistakes by the United States) could take different and overlapping forms. These forms include a disorderly or inconsistent value system; computational errors in calculation; an incapacity to communicate efficiently; random or haphazard influences in the making or transmittal of particular decisions; and internal dissonance generated by any authoritative structure of collective decision-making (e.g., the US National Security Council).

[29] See, by this author, at Oxford University Press: https://blog.oup.com/2011/10/war-winning/

[30] For much earlier similar warnings, by this author, see his October 1981 article at World Politics (Princeton): https://www.jstor.org/stable/2010149?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

[31] Clausewitzian friction refers to the unpredictable effects of errors in knowledge and information concerning strategic uncertainties; on presidential under-estimations or over-estimations of US relative power position; and on the unalterably vast and largely irremediable differences between theories of deterrence and enemy intent “as it actually is.” See: Carl von Clausewitz, “Uber das Leben und den Charakter von Scharnhorst,” Historisch-politische Zeitschrift, 1 (1832); cited in Barry D. Watts, Clausewitzian Friction and Future War, McNair Paper No. 52, October, 1996, Institute for National Strategic Studies, National Defense University Washington, D.C. p. 9.

[32] This also brings to mind an apt warning by French poet Guillaume Apollinaire, in The New Spirit and the Poets (1917): “It must not be forgotten that it is perhaps more dangerous for a nation to allow itself to be conquered intellectually than by arms.” Today, when the United States is under the flagrantly anti-intellectual leadership of Donald J. Trump, the poet’s warning should have a very clear and compelling resonance.

[33] Or “thorough study,” in the language of Sun-Tzu.

[34] The meaningless bifurcation of “attitude” and “preparation” was expressly invoked by Donald Trump before going off to his first summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jung Un. In that curious distinction, the US President openly favored the former.

[35] This vital reminder is also drawn from the strategic calculations of ancient Greece. See, for example, F.E. Adcock, The Greek and Macedonian Art of War (University of California, 1962).

[36] Accordingly, we may learn from ancient Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus, “”You are a citizen of the universe.” A broader idea of such “oneness” followed the death of Alexander in 322 BCE; with it came a coinciding doctrine of “universality.” By the Middle Ages, this political and social doctrine had fused with the notion of a Respublica Christiana, a worldwide Christian commonwealth, and Thomas, John of Salisbury and Dante were looking at Europe as a single and unified Christian community. Below the level of God and his heavenly host, all the realm of humanity was to be considered as one. This is because all the world had been created for the same single and incontestable purpose; that is, to provide background for the necessary drama of human salvation. Only in its relationship to the universe itself was the world correctly considered as a part rather than a whole. Said Dante in De Monarchia: “The whole human race is a whole with reference to certain parts, and, with reference to another whole, it is a part. For it is a whole with reference to particular kingdoms and nations, as we have shown; and it is a part with reference to the whole universe, which is evident without argument.” Today, of course, the idea of human oneness can be fully justified and explained in more purely secular terms of analytic understanding.

[37] In this connection, says Thomas Hobbes in Chapter XXI of Leviathan, “The obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect them.”

[38] “I tell you,” says Nietzsche in Zarathustra, “ye have still chaos in you.”

[39] See Merton’s The Nonviolent Alternative, 1980. Similar sentiments can be found in the German philosopher Immanuel Kant’s remark: “Out of timber so crooked as that from which man is made, nothing entirely straight can be built.” This is my own translation from the original German: “Aus so krummem Holze, als woraus der Mensch gemacht ist, kann nichts ganz Gerades gezimmert warden.” See: Isaiah Berlin, The Crooked Timber of Humanity, xi (Henry Handy, ed., 1991) quoting Immanuel Kant’s Idee Zu Einer Allgemeinen Geschichte In Weltburgerlicher Absicht (1784).

[40] These ideas have been most closely associated with the French Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, especially his modern classic The Phenomenon of Man (1955).

[41] Among some of the early books dealing with these effects ion a serious and informed way, see: Franklyn Griffiths and John C . Polanyi, editors, The Dangers of Nuclear War (1979); Arthur M. Katz, Life After Nuclear War (1982); and by this author, Louis René Beres: Apocalypse: Nuclear Catastrophe in World Politics (1980).

EN2897918,https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/553208-bangladesh-india-move-hundreds-of-thousands-away-from-cyclone-bulbul,,"MOUSOUNI ISLAND, India: Bangladeshi and Indian authorities on Saturday ordered more than 450,000 people to flee coastal villages and islands as Cyclone Bulbul headed for the Bay of Bengal coast.

The eye of the storm, packing winds of up to 120 kilometres (75 miles) per hour, was expected to hit land around the Bangladesh-India frontier late Saturday.

A storm surge up to two metres (seven feet) high was predicted along the coast, Bangladesh´s Meteorological Department said.

Bangladesh troops were sent to villages to help with the evacuation. About 55,000 volunteers were also going door-to-door to warn residents.

Minister for disaster management Enamur Rahman told AFP the evacuation of 400,000 people would be completed by Saturday evening.

""We´ve already evacuated some 391,000 people,"" he said.

About 1,500 tourists were stranded on the southern island of Saint Martin after boat services were suspended due to bad weather.

Bangladesh´s two biggest ports, Mongla and Chittagong, were closed because of the storm and flights into Chittagong airport have also been halted.

India also ordered an alert on its side of the border and the West Bengal government evacuated nearly 60,000 people in the state, officials said.

On the island of Mousouni, which lies in the path of the storm, scared residents took shelter in schools and government buildings because they had not been able to escape.

All flights at in and out of Kolkata airport were suspended for 12 hours and military planes and ships have been put on standby, Indian authorities said.

Winds of up to 110kph and heavy rainfall from the fringe of Bulbul have already lashed Odisha state, uprooting trees that blocked many roads.

Bulbul was expected to hit the coast at the Sundarbans, the world´s largest mangrove forest, which straddles Bangladesh and part of eastern India and is home to endangered species including the Bengal tiger.

Bangladesh´s low-lying coast, home to 30 million people, is regularly battered by cyclones that leave a trail of destruction.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in cyclones in recent decades.

While the frequency and intensity have increased, partly due to climate change, the death tolls have come down because of faster evacuations and the building of 4,000 cyclone shelters along the coast.

In November 2007, Cyclone Sidr killed more than 3,000 people. In May this year, Fani became the most powerful storm to hit the country in five years, but the death toll was about 12.",2019-11-09

It’s a sunny June afternoon in North Vancouver.

Lynn is sorting through a massive mound of bottles and cans spread across three overflowing shopping carts.

She’s lived outside the bottle depot on Brooksbank for the past three months.

LISTEN: Meet North Vancouver’s hidden homeless

“Even though I worked a good 25 years for the school board, my pension is not that great you know? And it’s hard, you can’t afford anything you can’t afford to eat, you can’t afford to live in an apartment or a house, nothing.”

Lynn and James' set-up in front of the Bottle Depot on Brooksbank Avenue. Robyn Crawford

Lynn shares her tent with her son James, who has lived on the North Shore his entire life. Both spoke on the condition that they be identified by their first names only.

When James found himself on disability it was no longer enough to afford his apartment, he said.

“It’s become hard to live,” said James.

“Do you pay your rent or do you eat your food? It’s become one of those situations.”

He says he lives on the streets of North Vancouver because this has always been his safe place.

“You know every time I’ve moved away from here I’ve always moved back, I like North Van this is my home, my families here.”

On the other side of town there’s Richard, who says all it took was a foreclosure to force him to sleep on the streets.

“Away it went, I was without a home, suddenly, I knew 30 days before that I was going to have to leave,” he said.

“A lot of people might think of homeless people being drug addicts, violent people maybe, but by far and large that’s not the case. I’ve met some very nice people, and they think the same thing: how did I end up being homeless?”

As for Loki, who has dealt with substance abuse in downtown Vancouver, being homeless in North Vancouver was an escape from the noise.

“It’s a bit more nature and quiet, and when its 12:00 a.m. at night here it’s peaceful, it’s quiet I’ve never been a huge city fan so it was a bit more chaotic across town,” he said.

According to a count done in 2017 by the North Shore Homelessness Task Force there were an estimated 736 homeless people living in North Vancouver.

There is only one shelter with 47 beds, no modular homes, and no provincially-funded social housing.

Shayne Williams is the CEO of the only shelter, operated by the Lookout Society.

“We serve three communities, our turn-away is atrocious,” he said.

“One shelter among three communities in this day and age, with this sheer volume of folks that need service on the North Shore doesn’t cut it.”

“If the definition of community is how we treat our most vulnerable, if that’s our score card, we’re not doing very well on the North Shore.”

But North Vancouver resident Jeremy says the homeless population doesn’t affect his local business. In fact, he barely notices them.

“I mean, I watch what’s going backward and forward here, there aren’t that many around.”

MLA for North Vancouver-Lonsdale Bowinn Ma says it’s the vast amount of space that makes the homeless so hidden.

“A lot of people think that the North Shore doesn’t have a lot of homelessness because they don’t see it on the streets quite as much as they would see it in Downtown Vancouver,” she said.

“But on the North Shore we have families living in their tents and their cars.”

Meanwhile, the province has allocated almost $20 million to build two mixed-income buildings on the North Shore.

But Ma says she’s not seeing action coming from the municipal level.

“I understand why a community like North Vancouver might be concerned about their neighborhood changing too quickly,” she said.

“But I would also be very concerned about them missing the opportunity to actually work with the provincial government who is eager, ready, and willing and has billions of dollars on the table right now to help them build that affordable housing.”

In fact, earlier this year, the District of North Vancouver mayor and council shut down a 100-unit affordable housing project.

Mayor Mike Little said in a statement the city will be working on a partnership focusing on vulnerable women later this year.

Williams says we need to be taking advantage of government funding.

“If you’ve got the political will and you’ve got the need, you have to be creating housing right now, and there’s no doubt about the need,” said Williams.

MP for North Vancouver Jonathan Wilkinson agrees it’s up to the municipalities to carry out these projects.

“There certainly is not enough shelter beds in North Vancouver to address the need, it is certainly something that has been a conversation for some substantial period time, I mean as you know most of these tools with respect to zoning and enabling the opening of these kind of facilities lie at the municipal level,” he told Global News.

Ma says she’s now pushing for the municipalities to say yes to modular homes.

“Just about a week ago or so sent a letter to all three North Shore municipalities urging them to consider modular housing for the North Shore,” she said.

Williams says he’s hoping for the same thing.

“ cautiously optimistic that the North Shore mayors can get together for the modular program because, certainly, we could easily get some folks here and some folks that we know live rough in the community, populate that very, very quickly,” he said.

“There’s been some conversations about another shelter opening locally and I think it’s more of a family-based , and it’s a little more different and we see, it and we welcome it with open arms, and it can’t happen fast enough.”

Wilkinson says funding will also be coming next year from the federal government.

“ part of the national housing strategy which comes into play next year, which essentially gives people a top-up to help them afford rent,” he said.

But for James, he’s just hoping for a rope to grab onto.

“We just want to live and just sustain a life, that’s it,” he said.

“We don’t want to be rich and have homes and banks and big bank accounts, we just want to make it. Basic needs are all we ask.”

EN2630316,https://www.humboldtjournal.ca/hong-kong-police-fire-tear-gas-water-as-protest-escalates-1.23852750,,"HONG KONG — Following a day of sit-ins, tear gas and clashes with police, Hong Kong students and civil rights activists vowed Wednesday to keep protesting a proposed extradition bill that has become a lightning rod for concerns over greater Chinese control and erosion of civil liberties in the former British colony. The violence marked a major escalation of the biggest political crisis in years for the semi-autonomous Chinese territory and forced the delay of legislative debate on the contentious bill. article continues below College student Louis Wong said he considered the blockade of government headquarters and the Legislative Council a success because it appeared to prevent Beijing loyalists from advancing amendments to a pair of laws that would make it easier to send suspected criminals to China. ""This is a public space and the police have no right to block us from staying here,"" Wong said, surveying a garbage-strewn intersection in the Admiralty neighbourhood that had been blocked off by security forces after protesters broke through a police cordon and entered the government complex. ""We'll stay until the government drops this law and (Chinese President) Xi Jinping gives up on trying to turn Hong Kong into just another city in China like Beijing and Shanghai,"" he said. Protesters who had massed outside the government building overnight Tuesday began pressing against the police early Wednesday, leading to police firing tear gast and pepper spray. The overwhelmingly young crowd overflowed onto a major downtown road as they overturned barriers and tussled with police. When some appeared to have breached a cordon around the building, the police launched their response. A weekend protest of the extradition measure drew hundreds of thousands of people, and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said in a statement early Thursday that the peaceful rally had become a ""blatant, organized riot."" At a brief news conference held as the chaos swirled outside on Wednesday afternoon, Police Commissioner Stephen Lo Wai-chung said the ""serious clashes"" forced police to use pepper spray, bean bag rounds, rubber bullets, and tear gas. Officers also were hurt, some seriously, by rocks, bottles, traffic cones, metal barricades and other items thrown by protesters. Police spokesman Gong Weng Chun defended the use of tear gas and other nonlethal weapons, saying officers wouldn't have had to do so if they weren't facing a threat that could lead to serious injury or death. As of 10 p.m. Wednesday, at least 72 people were brought to seven hospitals, with two in serious condition, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority said. Of those, 41 were later released, it added. Lo also called the demonstration a riot, which could mean long jail terms for anyone arrested, adding to fears that Hong Kong's government is using public disturbance laws to intimidate protesters. ""We condemn such irresponsible behaviour,"" Lo said. ""There's no need to hurt innocent people to express your opinions,"" he said, adding that people should not ""do anything they will regret for the rest of their lives."" A curt government statement said a scheduled 11 a.m. legislative session would be ""changed to a later time."" Officials gave no indication of when that would be, and Lam cancelled a news briefing. Some businesses also closed for the day, and labour strikes and class boycotts were called. The protests by the bill's opponents are the largest since pro-democracy demonstrations closed down parts of the Asian financial centre for more than three months in 2014. The demonstrations pose a challenge to Xi, who has said he would not tolerate Hong Kong being used as a base to question the ruling Communist Party's authority. But they are also giving a voice to the young in the territory who feel alienated by a political process dominated by the economic elite. The legislative process for the bill remained unclear following the violence, which largely ended by about 5 p.m. after police herded demonstrators across a pedestrian bridge. Traffic in one of the busiest parts of the city remained blocked, however, and several hundred protesters seemed in no hurry to leave. The protesters said they hoped the blockade would lead to the measure being shelved. ""We want the government to just set the legislation aside and not bring it back,"" said a protester who gave only his first name, Marco, because he feared possible repercussions from authorities. Another protester, who gave her name only as King, also fearing repercussions, said the protest was a watershed moment for Hong Kong's youth. ""We have to stand up for our rights or they will be taken away,"" she said. Dressed in black T-shirts and jeans, many protesters appeared undaunted by police demands to disperse. The demonstrators also appeared mindful of Beijing's growing use of electronic surveillance such as facial recognition technology to build dossiers on those it considers politically unreliable, and many of them wore surgical masks to hide their features as well as reduce the effects of tear gas. Such protests are never tolerated in mainland China, and Hong Kong residents can face travel bans and other repercussions if they cross the border. In an interview with Hong Kong broadcaster TVB, Lam denied she was ""selling out"" Hong Kong with the extradition bill but conceded the measure would continue to attract criticism. ""It's time to let lawmakers with different opinions express their views under the legislative process,"" she said. ""On whether to retract or push it through ... our consideration is this: There is no doubt this issue is controversial. Explanation and dialogue are useful but perhaps that has not entirely dispelled worries."" Speaking of her commitment to her job, her voice broke as she said: ""They said I'm selling out Hong Kong. How could I do that? I grew up here with everyone else in the city."" Lam added that she has never ""felt guilty"" over the issue and believed she was doing the right thing. She said she felt ""worried and sad"" about the young protesters, but said that as a parent of two sons, she believed it would be wrong to cave in to ""wilfulbehaviour."" Under its ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong was supposed to be guaranteed the right to retain its own social, legal and political systems for 50 years following its handover from British rule in 1997. However, China's Communist Party has been seen as increasingly reneging on that agreement by forcing through unpopular laws. A vote on the legislation is scheduled on June 20. China's Foreign Ministry repeated its support for the bil, with spokesman Geng Shuang denying Beijing has been interfering in the city's affairs in a way that violates agreements made when Hong Kong was handed back to China. ""Hong Kong people's rights and freedoms have been fully guaranteed in accordance with law,"" he said. At the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump called it as ""big a demonstration as I've ever seen,"" adding: ""I hope it all works out for China and for Hong Kong."" In a statement, Australia's Foreign Ministry called for both sides to show restraint and said it had raised concerns about the proposed amendments at senior levels within the Hong Kong government. The protests are widely seen as reflecting growing apprehension about relations with the mainland, where Xi has said he has zero tolerance for those demanding greater self-rule for Hong Kong. Critics believe the extradition legislation would put Hong Kong residents at risk of becoming trapped in China's judicial system, in which opponents of Communist Party rule have been charged with economic crimes or ill-defined national security offences, and would not be guaranteed free trials. Lam said the government has considered concerns from the private sector and altered the bill to improve human rights safeguards. She said without the changes, Hong Kong risked becoming a haven for fugitives. She emphasized that extradition cases would be decided by Hong Kong courts. Opponents say the changes would significantly compromise Hong Kong's legal independence, long viewed as one of the crucial differences between the territory and the mainland. Hong Kong now limits extradition to jurisdictions with which it has existing agreements and to others on an individual basis. China has been excluded from those agreements because of concerns over its judicial independence and human rights record. ___ Associated Press writers Raf Wober and Alice Fung in Hong Kong, Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, Kevin Freking in Washington and Sally Ho in Seattle contributed.",2019-06-12

EN2576337,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/?post_type=news&p=1926620,,"The White House on Tuesday instructed Don McGahn, its former counsel, to refuse to comply with a congressional subpoena for documents related to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia inquiry, intensifying a fight between President Donald Trump’s administration and Democratic lawmakers.

McGahn, who left his post as White House counsel last year, was directed not to produce White House records sought in the subpoena issued by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, according to the current White House counsel, Pat Cipollone.

It was the latest episode in an escalating fight between the Republican president and Democrats, who control the House and are seeking documents and testimony relating to various investigations, ahead of the 2020 presidential election in which Trump is seeking a second four-year term.

Cipollone said in a letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler that McGahn was given the documents during the investigation “with the clear understanding that the records remain subject to the control of the White House for all purposes.”

Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, a former House Republican, directed McGahn not to produce the records, the letter said.

“The White House records remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles, because they implicate significant executive branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege,” Cipollone wrote.

Executive privilege is a right claimed by presidents to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government.

A Republican congressional aide said the White House was not asserting executive privilege over the documents and pointed to Cipollone’s readiness to respond to further congressional inquiries about the records. “Conversations … would not occur if, in fact, the White House had asserted privilege here,” the aide said.

Nadler had asked McGahn to produce the documents by Tuesday morning. The committee also subpoenaed McGahn to testify at a deposition. Neither committee officials nor McGahn’s lawyer were immediately available to comment on whether he would do so.

“Because Mr. McGahn does not have the legal right to disclose these documents to third parties, I would ask the committee to direct any request for such records to the White House, the appropriate legal custodian,” Cipollone said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told ABC earlier she did not believe McGahn would comply with the subpoena. “I don’t anticipate that that takes place,” Sanders said.

House Democrats have sought McGahn’s cooperation as part of their investigation of possible corruption and obstruction of justice by Trump. Trump denies wrongdoing.

Mueller’s 448-page report referred to conversations in June 2017 in which Trump called McGahn to tell him he should direct Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was overseeing the special counsel’s probe, to remove Mueller because of alleged conflicts of interest.

The report cited “McGahn’s clear recollection” that the president directed him to tell Rosenstein that “Mueller has to go.” McGahn did not carry out Trump’s order, the report said.

Trump also tried unsuccessfully to get McGahn to dispute media reports that the president had attempted to fire Mueller, the report said.

Trump is fighting congressional Democrats on several fronts.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday denied a request by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal for Trump’s tax returns.

The House Judiciary Committee has set a vote for Wednesday on whether to cite Attorney General William Barr with contempt of Congress over his refusal to provide it with a full, unredacted version of Mueller’s report and underlying evidence from the investigation.

Trump, his three oldest children and the Trump Organization also have sued Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp to try to block them from responding to U.S. congressional subpoenas issued by Democrats seeking financial records.

Republicans in Congress have rejected the efforts of Democratic-led House committees as political gamesmanship intended to appeal to the Democratic Party’s voting base ahead of the 2020 election.",2019-05-07

Officers were targeted after finding a suspicious object while carrying out searches for New IRA bomb-making equipment in the Creggan Heights area of the city.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland later confirmed the object was a “viable explosive device”. Having evacuated some 15 homes late on Monday night, they tweeted soon after 5.00 am that the device had been made safe and residents could return to their dwellings.

Young people engaged in the disorder in Derry’s Creggan estate sustained burn injuries during the violence on Monday night, the PSNI said.

The police searches were launched after a dissident republican mortar bomb was recovered in Strabane, Co Tyrone on Saturday.

The mortar, which was positioned close to a family home, was aimed at the town’s police station.

It was the seventh attempted murder bid against the security forces in Northern Ireland this year.

Journalist Lyra McKee, 29, was murdered by the New IRA in the same Creggan Heights area in April as she observed dissident rioting.

The incident remains under investigation. — PSNI DC&S District (@PSNIDCSDistrict) September 9, 2019

PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton described the operation around the suspicious object as “complex” as he condemned those indulging in disorder.

“The focus of this operation is ensuring the people of Creggan are safe however it is concerning to see significant numbers of young people on the streets, late into the night, throwing petrol bombs and other missiles at officers in the area,” he said late on Monday night.

“The reality is this type of disorder contributes to the complexity of the policing operation and presents a real risk of injury to those involved.

“Already we have seen two incidents this evening where young people have sustained burn injuries as result of engaging in disorder.

“I would reiterate our appeal for those young people to return home and remove themselves from the situation.

“We are grateful for the support of community representatives in helping to reduce tensions and providing space for officers to carry out the necessary work to ensure this object does not present a risk to the people of Creggan.”

Sinn Fein Assembly member Karen Mullan said the security alert had caused significant disruption to local residents. She also condemned the disorder.

“There is absolutely no justification for the actions which serve no purpose other than to put people at risk of serious harm and make the situation worse for local residents trying to get on with their lives, and they should stop now,” she said.

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood appealed for calm in the area.

“Police officers came into Creggan today to take bombs out of the hands of those who are trying to murder innocent people in our communities, like those responsible for the mortar in Strabane,” the Foyle MLA said on Monday night.

“The brutal and sustained attack that officers have come under while trying to make our community safe is disgusting. Young people in this community are being manipulated and are risking their futures as a result. I would urge parents to contact their children and take them out of harm’s way.

“People in this community will not be held to ransom by those who want to hold us all back.”",2019-09-10

The Tibetan diaspora community in Switzerland accuses the Chinese government of using repressive tactics in the Alpine nation.

Switzerland’s German-language weekly NZZ am Sonntag cited on Sunday a letter from the three most prominent Tibetan organisations to Swiss President Ueli Maurer.

“The Tibetan community in exile in Switzerland is increasingly being watched and systematically intimidated by the Chinese government,"" the letter claims.

This intimidation is particularly evident at rallies, but control efforts are also increasingly manifest in the digital world.

""China's self-confident and demanding behaviour is noticeable in relation to the Tibetan exile community in Switzerland, among other things,"" says Isabelle Graber, aspokeswoman for the Swiss Federal Intelligence Service.

""Official receptions of the [Tibetan spiritual leader] Dalai Lama will no longer be tolerated by China in any way and will be punished retroactively with various measures,” she noted.



Last March, Defence Minister Viola Amherd, whose department includes the intelligence service, said ""the surveillance of exiled communities in Switzerland violates Switzerland's sovereignty and democratic values.”

There are some 7,500 members of the Tibetan diaspora living in Switzerland.

The NZZ am Sonntag report gave several examples of Tibetan groups coming under pressure from Beijing in Switzerland.

One involved the Chinese ambassador to Switzerland setting up a meeting with Swiss parliament at the exact same time it was supposed to receive Tibetan groups. The Tibetan event was scrapped.

Chinese representatives reportedly sought to dissuade Swiss politicians from officially welcoming the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, when he visited Switzerland last September.

In addition, Chinese authorities try to nip Tibetan demonstrations in the bud by intervening with the governments of the relevant countries.



China denies the accusations. “They come out of nowhere and are unfounded,"" said the media department of the Chinese Embassy in Bern.

Meanwhile, Switzerland’s foreign affairs ministry has announced that it will receive a Tibetan delegation to discuss the situation.



Currently, between 15 and 25 Tibetans per month apply for asylum in Switzerland. Some of them hail from the Tibetan diaspora in India or Nepal rather than China.



Maurer visited China in April and signed a memorandum of understanding confirming Switzerland’s future participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative.
